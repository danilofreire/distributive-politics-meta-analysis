"Can civil servants in a developing democracy successfully resist political capture in the distribution of public goods? Existing research tends to highlight political patronage logics of distribution, and scholarship focuses primarily on politicians’ motivations. But service decisions are often made by bureaucrats, who sometimes explicitly try to avoid capture and allocate on the basis of need. Using qualitative interviews and spatial regressions with geo-coded data from a solar panel program in Ghana, we examine such a situation. We show that, despite considerable efforts to thwart it, national-level civil servants were unable to fully resist political capture. While solar panel distribution partially corresponded to need for electricity, we find that panels also went to areas where voter turnout was historically inconsistent, likely to motivate voter turnout. The direction of these relationships was consistent across subnational space, but the magnitudes varied considerably and were strongest in districts adjacent to Lake Volta. Qualitative data analysis reveals that this subnational variation reflects the logistics of space and the historical politics of place. The article contributes to theories of distributive politics and of voting behavior, and highlights the need for subnational disaggregation across space. © 2019",spatial analysis of bureaucrats’ attempts to resist political capture in a developing democracy: the distribution of solar panels in ghana,2020,Political Geography,"Brass, J.N., Schon, J., Baldwin, E., MacLean, L.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The foundational model of distributive politics predicts a positive relationship between the number of legislative districts and the level of inefficiency of projects approved by the legislature—Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen's “Law of 1/n.” This relationship has been tested extensively in the empirical literature, with mixed results. This article presents a model wherein passing the omnibus legislation typical of distributive politics is a costly process. The model predicts a nonlinear relationship between legislature size and spending as increasing the size of the legislature also increases the costs of collective action. Results from an empirical exercise based on U.S. state legislatures (1962–2014) are consistent with the proposed model, showing a 1/n effect which diminishes at the margin as the legislature's size increases, especially in the lower chamber. © 2019 by the Southern Economic Association","the law of 1/n revisited: distributive politics, legislature size, and the costs of collective action",2019,Southern Economic Journal,"Crowley, G.R.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,3
"One might obtain special favor or avoid disfavor by winning a competitive contest, a socially wasteful process that has been studied extensively in the rent-seeking literature. But favor or disfavor might also be uncontestable. In that case it will be efficient along some dimensions but grossly inequitable. The rent-seeking literature, in focusing on contest success functions, has tended to ignore the institutional roots of uncontestable rent-creation and rent-extraction. But casual observation suggests that institutional rules and cultural norms often ensure that favor and disfavor cannot be easily contested. Understanding that observation helps to resolve the Tullock paradox and explains the evolutionary persistence of inequitable social arrangements. It also illuminates economic and philosophical tradeoffs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",uncontestable favoritism,2019,Public Choice,"Mitchell, M.D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Does giving citizens the power to decide budget policies improve fiscal discipline in the local public sector? This study examines the effects of local initiatives on city budgetary solvency or the ability of city governments to generate revenues to meet their service and financial obligations in a fiscal year. Budgetary imbalance in the public sector has been blamed on self-interested bureaucrats and elected officials who desire budgets that are higher than that preferred by the median voter. The initiative gives citizens the power to directly decide budget issues. Research shows that voters are more fiscally conservative than government officials, which suggests that fiscal discipline will improve if citizens exercise greater control over budgeting. Using data from audited financial reports for midsized and large cities from 2006 to 2012, the empirical analysis indicates that initiative cities have weaker budgetary solvency compared with noninitiative cities. © The Author(s) 2018.",power to the people? the initiative process and fiscal discipline in city governments,2019,Urban Affairs Review,"Jimenez, B.S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",5
"The article sheds light on two missing links in the existing literature on government’s policy preferences and policy choices, namely the roles played by party factions and trade unions as political actors able to affect government’s decision-making power. The content analysis of a wide typology of documents (i.e., investiture speeches, parliamentary debates, motions discussed during parties’ and trade unions’ congresses) allows to locate cabinets, parties, party factions and trade unions on a common pro-state/pro-market scale. Using these new data sources, we perform a multivariate time-series analysis to estimate the relative impact of those political actors on social expenditure in Italy throughout its modern history (1946–2015). The results support the idea that intra-party dynamics and trade unions’ preferences do matter. Indeed, government’s ability to retrench the welfare state vanishes when the Prime Minister’s party is highly polarized internally and when trade unions are more cohesive.",intra-party politics and interest groups: missing links in explaining government effectiveness,2019,Public Choice,"Ceron, A., Curini, L., Negri, F.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Public spending arguably increases with the number of parties in government as each party seeks to secure benefits to its target groups. In this study, two factors that affect the budgetary consequences of multiparty government are identified. The first is the distribution of a priori voting power. An uneven distribution of voting power implies that all government parties are not expected to be equally successful in budgetary negotiations. The second is the degree of impartiality of the public sector. If the public sector is characterized by corruption and other forms of partiality, distributive issues can be expected to gain importance in representative politics. An analysis of data from 30 European countries suggests that changes in the number of government parties are associated with changes in public spending in cases where equally powerful parties are in government and the public sector is relatively partial. © 2019 European Consortium for Political Research.","not always on an equal footing: power, partiality and the conditional effect of multiparty government on public spending",2019,European Political Science Review,"Ylisalo, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",7
"This study examines the impact of legislature size on local public finance and service outcomes in Indonesia. The investigation employs both continuity- and randomization-based regression discontinuity methods to accommodate the endogeneity of council size and to identify its causal effects on local government spending, service delivery, and own-source revenue mobilization. Many studies have examined the influence of increasing legislature size on expenditures, but no consensus has emerged on the direction of impacts. Moreover, interpretation of the efficiency of derived spending effects has remained elusive and reliant on ad hoc theorizing. This is the first study to examine the causal impact of council size on service outcomes, thereby facilitating an empirically based understanding of efficiency effects. The study finds that increasing legislature size negatively affects local government total and capital spending. The investigation also shows that rising legislature size has a negative influence on citizen access to public services. Finally, the examination offers evidence to suggest that an increasing number of legislators have no impact on local own-source revenues. Taken together the results imply a decline in local efficiency: residents pay the same amount in taxes but receive fewer services. The findings in this investigation contradict recent theoretical predictions and empirical results from other research.","legislature size, local government expenditure and taxation, and public service access in indonesia",2019,Studies in Comparative International Development,"Lewis, B.D.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,8
"Over the past several decades, prominent public management and policy scholars have repeatedly identified institutional analysis as a promising tool for empirical research, particularly for the study of ‘new governance’ phenomena where policy is enacted and implemented by actors that span organizations, sectors, jurisdictions, and governance levels. Yet, relatively few empirical studies directly measure and model institutions in management and policy settings.

"Why do representatives prioritize certain types of constituency service in parliamentary systems? This study argues that the choice for constituency-oriented activities is conditioned by both partisan factors and legislative role orientations. Two novel data sets combining behavioral and attitudinal measures of constituency-oriented behavior are used for empirical tests: an elite survey including detailed interviews with 204 members of the Turkish parliament and 4000 parliamentary questions tabled by these members. The results from a series of ordered logit, ordinary least squares (OLS), and negative binomial regression estimations confirm that members of parliament choose different types of constituency-oriented activities based on their visibility to the party leadership and their constituency. This choice is primarily driven by partisanship and members of parliament’s perceptions about the influence of party leader in renomination. The analysis provides important insights about the role of partisan factors as drivers of parliamentary behavior. © The Author(s) 2017.",hiding behind the party brand or currying favor with constituents: why do representatives engage in different types of constituency-oriented behavior?,2019,Party Politics,"Ciftci, S., Yildirim, T.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We examine the distribution of economic productivity across subnational regions as a factor explaining the level and allocation of central government expenditure. As regional productivity becomes more dispersed, the preferences influencing national decision making should diverge, thus impeding agreement to expand the central state. However, if regional productivity becomes more right-skewed, an increasing number of less productive regions may be able to press for greater central outlays. Dispersion and skew of interregional inequality also shape the allocation of centralized spending. With growing economic dispersion across regions, decision makers are more likely to fund policy categories that aid citizens in all regions over those that are locally targeted. By contrast, with the distribution of regional productivity skewing farther to the right, central expenditure is likely to become more locally targeted. We find strong evidence for these propositions in error correction models using new measures of interregional inequality and government policy priorities for 24 OECD countries. © 2019 by the Southern Political Science Association.

"Pork-barrel spending is the appropriation of federal money for use in projects that only benefit narrowly defined groups. In the past, researchers have attempted to show that pork-barrel spending increases the likelihood of an incumbent being reelected but empirical evidence has been hard to find. I hypothesize that pork-barrel spending does not directly increase the likelihood of reelection; instead, pork-barrel spending can be used to increase fundraising and the additional campaign funds are then used to increase the likelihood of being reelected. I find that a $10 million increase in pork-barrel spending will lead to a 0.10% increase in the share of the vote in an election. While this may not seem like a major advantage to some, several elections over the past few years have been decided by < 1%. Therefore, legislators in tightly contested races may be able to use pork-barrel spending to gain some degree of separation from their challenger. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",using tax dollars for re-election: the impact of pork-barrel spending on electoral success,2019,Constitutional Political Economy,"Klingensmith, J.Z.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We study distributive politics inside cities by analysing how local governments allocate investment projects to voters across neighbourhoods. In particular, we ask whether politicians use investment to target their own supporters. To this aim, we use detailed geo-located investment data from Plan E, a large fiscal stimulus program carried out in Spain in 2009–2011. Our main empirical strategy is based on a close-elections regression-discontinuity design. In contrast to previous studies – which use aggregate data at the district or municipal level – we exploit spatial variation in both investment and voter support within municipalities and find no evidence of supporter targeting. Complementary results indicate that voters may be responding to investment by increasing turnout. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",distributive politics inside the city? the political economy of spain's plan e,2019,Regional Science and Urban Economics,"Carozzi, F., Repetto, L.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Over the past four decades, government debt as a fraction of GDP has been on an upward trajectory in advanced economies, approaching levels not reached since World War II. While normative macroeconomic theories can explain the increase in the level of debt in certain periods as a response to macroeconomic shocks, they cannot explain the broad-based long-run trend in debt accumulation. In contrast, political economy theories can explain the long-run trend as resulting from an aging population, rising political polarization, and rising electoral uncertainty across advanced economies. These theories emphasize the time-inconsistency in government policymaking, and thus the need for fiscal rules that restrict policymakers. Fiscal rules trade off commitment to not overspend and flexibility to react to shocks. This tradeoff guides design features of optimal rules, such as information dependence, enforcement, cross-country coordination, escape clauses, and instrument vs. target criteria.",rising government debt: causes and solutions for a decades-old trend,2019,Journal of Economic Perspectives,"Yared, P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Legislators are political actors whose main goal is to get re-elected. They use their legislative repertoire to help them cater to the interests of their principals. It is argued in this article that we need to move beyond treating electoral systems as monolithic entities, as if all legislators operating under the same set of macro-rules shared the same set of incentives. Rather, we need to account for within-system variation – namely, candidate selection rules and individual electoral vulnerability. Using a most different systems design, Germany, Ireland and Portugal are leveraged with both cross-system and within-system variation. An original dataset of 345,000 parliamentary questions is used. Findings show that candidate selection rules blur canonical electoral system boundaries. Electoral vulnerability has a similar effect in closed-list and mixed systems, but not in preferential voting settings. © 2018 European Consortium for Political Research",the impact of candidate selection rules and electoral vulnerability on legislative behaviour in comparative perspective,2019,European Journal of Political Research,"Fernandes, J.M., Geese, L., Schwemmer, C.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

The empirical results indicate that the pork-barrel effect in at-large electoral systems is of very small economic magnitude.

"When two policies are available to achieve the same goal why is the relatively inefficient one often observed? We address this question in the context of policies used to redistribute income towards special interest groups (SIGs) where in the first stage the constraints on policy instruments are chosen and in the second the government bargains with SIGs over the level of the available policies. Restrictions on the use of efficient policies and the use of inefficient ones reduce the surplus over which SIGs and governments can bargain but it also improves the government's bargaining position thus increasing its share of the surplus. The positive effect for the government dominates under plausible conditions. Inefficient policies are the equilibrium outcome under alternative policy selection mechanisms, e.g., election of policymakers and bargaining between SIGs and the government. The model also explains the coexistence of transfer policies. Moreover, we show why a weak government is more likely to choose the inefficient transfer and discuss how this result may be tested. © 2019 ALLAN DRAZEN.",a bargaining theory of inefficient redistribution policies,2019,World Scientific Studies in International Economics,"Drazen, A., Limão, N.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Public goods networks create conflict between districts needing the network and districts that pay the costs. Thus, it is difficult for pork barrel politicians to achieve logrolling with other districts. I show that logrolling is possible for such politicians if they set their agenda properly. To show this, I model the centralized decision-making process as a multistage vote among representatives from different districts. I assume the districts are better off if and only if the public good “connects” them to the network.

"This paper investigates whether the large scale municipal amalgamations in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in the early 1970s led to considerable common pool exploitation. Through amalgamation the resources of several municipalities are pooled together disclosing the former independent municipalities a larger source of funds. Additionally, the pooling also decreases the cost of local public goods, as those have to be borne by the whole of the amalgamated municipality. By exploiting the huge variance in the amalgamation process in terms of number of participating municipalities, but also in municipality size or amalgamation strategy, we identify considerable common pool effects. Amalgamated municipalities show considerably stronger acceleration in debt accumulation compared to non-amalgamating municipalities. This common pool exploitation is stronger if more municipalities participate and when municipalities amalgamate by annexation.",common pool effects and local public debt in amalgamated municipalities,2019,Public Choice,"Fritz, B., Feld, L.P.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",21
"I estimate the impact of Nebraska’s 1937 switch from a bicameral to a unicameral legislature on state-level government expenditures. Using the synthetic control method I create a counterfactual Nebraska from a weighted average of other potential control states and compare spending in this “synthetic Nebraska” to spending in the real Nebraska. Relative to the synthetic control, Nebraska experiences a sharp decrease in expenditures per capita immediately following the switch to a unicameral legislature; however, the difference appears to diminish over time. Placebo tests show that if the change in Nebraska’s legislative structure were randomly assigned among the sample of states, and legislative structure had no real impact on spending, the likelihood of obtaining a treatment-effect estimate as large as Nebraska’s would be 0.0213. While the initial drop in expenditures per capita lends support to the theory that bicameralism, by requiring more veto players, is associated with higher levels of government spending, the fact that the difference between Nebraska and synthetic Nebraska diminishes suggests that legislators are able to circumvent this constraint. © The Author(s) 2019.","finally, nebraska: a synthetic control analysis of legislative structure",2019,State Politics and Policy Quarterly,"Hankins, W.B.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",22
"Executive control of government is generally not a long-term job. In such cases, relatively short executive tenure should be expected to play an important role in determining the degree to which policymakers internalize the future costs associated with their current fiscal behavior. The effects of policymaker's expected planning horizons on macroeconomic outcomes, however, have been difficult to model outside of a fixed term limit context due to the unobserved likelihood of remaining in office, along with potential endogeneity problems where re-election campaigns can be enhanced with generous, deficit-financed expenditures in election years. From a globally representative sample of 79 countries over a 32-year period (1980-2012), this paper provides empirical evidence suggesting that incumbent governments who know that will not be in office in the following period with a probability of one, are found to generate significantly higher deficits in a linear discounting model, and are found to produce the least responsible fiscal outcomes where the likelihood of re-election is around fifty percent in quadratic discounting models. © The European Political Science Association, 2019.",fiscal deficits and executive planning horizons,2019,Political Science Research and Methods,"Seiferling, M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Municipal amalgamations can create incentives for opportunistic behaviour. Several fairly recent studies have examined this on amalgamations in Denmark and Sweden using the so-called law of 1 over n. However, they have yielded inconclusive results and I argue that one plausible explanation is a theoretical deficiency in the law, as it does not account for how future political representation can mitigate the incentive to free-ride. I examine this using large-scale amalgamations in Denmark in 2007. This case is quite unique as the amalgamations were implemented in such a manner that they constitute a quasi-experiment, and because an extra fiscal year was added to the election period where the composition of the new councils was known with certainty, while the municipalities retained some decision-making power. The study’s findings are consistent with the argument that the incentive to free-ride depends on the decision makers’ future political stake in the new, amalgamated municipality. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",exploiting the common pool or looking to the future? a study of free-riding leading up to the 2007 municipal amalgamations in,2019,Local Government Studies,"Hansen, S.W.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",24
"In the context of recent economic and financial crisis in Europe, questions about the power of the core executive to control fiscal outcomes are more important than ever. Why are some governments more effective in controlling spending while others fall prey to excessive overspending by individual cabinet ministers? We approach this question by lifting the veil of collective cabinet responsibility and focusing on intra-cabinet decision-making around budgetary allocation. Using the contributions of individual cabinet members during budget debates in Ireland, we estimate their positions on a latent dimension that represents their relative levels of support or opposition to the cabinet leadership. We find some evidence that ministers who are close to the finance minister receive a larger budget share, but under worsening macro-economic conditions closeness to the prime minister is a better predictor for budget allocations.

"This article analyses how the presence of a dominant group of voters within the electorate affects voter turnout.

"After the economic downturn of 2008, youth unemployment rose rapidly in the EU. Simultaneously, many countries were also facing increasing public deficits. In this context, the EU developed a set of policies to tackle youth unemployment and public debt. While policies to fight unemployment were underpinned by the concept of social investment, austerity was seen as the best way to reduce public debt. These different approaches to the crisis led to a growing tension between the two policy areas. This problem was particularly visible in the countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis where youth unemployment remained very high for a long period of time. Not only were countries with high public debt and low growth unable to invest sufficiently in active labour market policies (ALMPs), but also, at the same time, austerity policies depressed the economic activity. This study uses the fsQCA methodology. Our results point to the existence of one necessary condition for high youth unemployment—low expenditure on ALMPs. The analysis of sufficient conditions points to the existence of one configuration: the countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis and characterized by having a demand-led growth model, combined a low GDP growth with a low expenditure on ALMPs. Together, this led to high levels of youth unemployment. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",understanding massive youth unemployment during the eu sovereign debt crisis: a configurational study,2019,Comparative European Politics,"Marques, P., Hörisch, F.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article shows that the troika institutions – the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – formed a technocratic consensus about the desirability of establishing national fiscal councils in the European Union (EU). Considerable disagreement existed, however, with regard to their design features. Each institution promoted a distinct mode of indirect governance by ranking national fiscal councils depending on their adopted governance model (agent, trustee or orchestrator). This persuasion, through entrepreneurial benchmarking, constitutes an important mechanism by which member states were nudged to adopt a distinct fiscal council model.

"Previous studies find that legislators who adopt a partisan voting record are penalized come election time. To date, these studies examine the electoral effects of aggregate legislative behavior. While useful for identifying macro-level relationships, this approach discards valuable information about the timing of elite partisanship that contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between legislative behavior and election outcomes. After all, studies find that recent elite behavior tends to factor more prominently in voters’ decision calculus. We offer a model that more explicitly accounts for the timing of elite partisanship, and we test it using US House elections data from 1956 to 2004.

Results show that representation impacts ecosystem vitality more so than public health. We account for this gap by arguing that levels of political representation influence the allocation of public and private goods which, in turn, help determine environmental outcomes. Our findings do not always paint a consistent picture, which may be attributed to the difficulties of operationalizing complex concepts such as environmental performance within and across countries and examining how these relationships change over time. Additional research is warranted to tease out these relationships. © The Author(s) 2019.",a political–institutional explanation of environmental performance in latin america,2019,International Area Studies Review,"Rey, D., Ozymy, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Can elections serve as a vector of good public policy in fledgeling democracies where electorally persistent elites circumvent institutional safeguards? Examining legislative productivity for each member of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1992 to 2016, we argue that while electoral persistence can be short-run welfare enhancing by inducing legislative attention on particularistic policies, it is ultimately electoral competition and the prospect of ouster that determine overall legislative behaviour. Using various measures of electoral competition, our panel estimates suggest that district incumbents who faced competitive elections, regardless of political pedigree, are more likely to work for the passage of their legislative proposals into legislation. The results lend credence to the disciplining effect of elections, even in precarious political settings where competition is between equally persistent political elites. Overall, incumbents who fought competitive elections are generally more likely to produce laws as a legislative preoccupation–a commitment they are likely to pursue even in the presence of institutional and political uncertainties. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","electoral persistence and the quality of public policies: evidence from the dynamics of lawmaking in the philippine house of representatives, 1992-2016",2019,Journal of Asian Public Policy,"Panao, R.A.L.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",33
"The purpose of this paper is to present and assess the literature about the determinants of public spending. Its originality is the adoption of a methodological perspective. Does econometrics allow economists to discover universal constants for public spending or is it only another way of writing the history of public finance? The economic theory of the size of government includes 23 explanations and 78 explanatory variables. The size of government reflects the preferences of citizens (demand model), the power of politicians and bureaucrats to impose their interests against citizens’ interests (supply model) and the constitutional design that governments face in raising revenue. Nonetheless, the great instability of econometric tests shows, all the difficulties of the science of public finance in finding a constant and discovering real causality between these variables. The analytical consequence of this result is the great futility of the search for a general law of the dynamic of public spending. This futility can be interpreted as a consequence of the complexity of political exchange. The size of the state is a multi-causal phenomenon. The prescriptive consequence is that it is not possible to use quantitative analysis to defend a form of “causal manipulationism” and predict the timing of state reforms and a political strategy to reduce the share of public spending in production. Econometrics is only one way of reporting the history of public finances. © 2019, International Atlantic Economic Society.",what are the determinants of public spending? an overview of the literature,2018,Atlantic Economic Journal,"Facchini, F.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",34
"We analyze the effect of council size on municipal expenditures by using a rich data set providing information on Italian municipal budgets over the period 2001-2007. The Italian law establishing that council size is a step function of population size allows us to estimate the effect of council size by implementing a Sharp Regression Discontinuity Design. We find a negative relationship between local government size, as measured by total expenditures per capita, and the council size, after controlling for the share of employees within local government apparatus, for the quality of public goods provided and for the degree of civicness: increasing the number of members within the council leads to a greater ability to control bureaucrats and consequently to a higher level of productivity in the public administration. Similar results are found when we consider expenditures that are more directly under control of bureaucrats, namely current expenditures per capita. Finally, increasing the number of legislators positively affects the level of efficiency/productivity of municipalities. © SOCIETÀ EDITRICE IL MULINO","council size, government spending and efficiency. evidence from a quasi-experimental design for italian municipalities",2018,Politica Economica,"De Benedetto, M.A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",35
"Italy was created in 1861 through military annexation by the Kingdom of Savoy (with capital city Torino in Piedmont) of other Italian territories. Immediately thereafter, the new national government started to extend Piedmontese laws to the new nation’s southern regions, introducing conscription and heavy taxation. The institutions and body politics of the pre-unification Italian states differed considerably. The new state centralized governmental power to level those differences. The southern people, were subjected to heavy-handed coercion, if not exploitation. The paper focuses on the coercion imposed by fiscal policies on the South. It asks whether coercion from the center was attenuated by redistribution operated at the regional and, especially, at the personal level with a focus on the poor. The answers confirm that fiscal coercion was indeed formidable. The Italian state imposed a heavy tax burden on the poor of all regions. When public expenditure also is brought in the picture, the poor in the southern regions remained disadvantaged, but less than they were before unification. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",coercion and equity with centralization of government: how the unification of italy impacted the southern regions,2018,Public Choice,"Brosio, G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Intermunicipal cooperation is a common way to provide local public services, exploit economies of scale, and internalize externalities. However, little is known about possible efficiency gains. We test their existence in terms of local public expenditures reductions, by investigating the Italian experience of municipal unions. We adopt quasi-experimental methodologies using administrative data on municipalities in the Emilia Romagna region. We find that being in a municipal union reduces the total per capita current expenditures by around 5 percent, without affecting the level of local public services.

"The policy agenda literature shows that budget cuts tend to be rarer and less extreme than budget expansions. This article argues that the character of retrenchment policies is shaped by a combination of domestic and international factors, such as budgetary procedures, intra-coalitional conflicts, and the emergence of urgency situations. Building on the findings of several quantitative studies on budgetary changes, we develop two propositions explaining why the necessity to reduce expenditures usually leads to across-the-board cuts. We also hypothesize two mechanisms which can occasionally produce selective outcomes. This article focuses on the last 30 years to observe how the annual package of public finance corrections has impacted on the main categories of public spending. This analysis combines an original measure of the transformative nature of the yearly fiscal packages approved by parliament with process-tracing methodology. The qualitative analysis focuses on three cases of linear cuts and one deviant case of selective cuts. Findings show that the persistence of frictions in the Italian budgetary process is often a basic reason for the introduction of linear cuts, but the logic of urgency triggered by the European external constraint was able to produce a selective outcome. © Società Italiana di Scienza Politica 2018.",misery loves company. strategies for retrenchment in the era of constrained public finance,2018,Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,"Cavalieri, A., Russo, F., Verzichelli, L.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Is cohesion policy effective? Does it contribute to the reduction of development disparities and strengthen competitiveness in the European Union? These are the questions that have inspired a growing body of research on cohesion policy evaluation, and which has come to varied and inconclusive results. There has been significant variation with regards to the established (in)effectiveness of cohesion policy among different methodological approaches, which all have serious methodological shortcomings. In order to circumvent these, the authors have not only continued to rely on rigorous econometric methods but also focused on the potential benefits through an indirect estimation approach.

"California and Washington recently replaced traditional partisan elections with nonpartisan ""top-two"" election procedures. Some reform advocates hoped that voters would behave in a way to support moderate candidates in the primary stage; the limited evidence for this behaviour has led some scholars to conclude that the reform has little chance to change meaningful policy outcomes. Yet we find that the nonpartisan procedure has predictable and disparate political consequences: the general elections between two candidates of the same party, called copartisan general elections, tend to occur in districts without any meaningful crossparty competition. Furthermore, copartisan elections are more likely to occur with open seats, when a new legislator will begin building a network of relationships.

"This study examines redistribution policy through personal income taxes in Swiss cantons over the period 1995–2011. In a first step, redistribution measures are estimated with the help of exhaustive administrative data. Redistribution is decomposed into average tax rate and tax progression. In a second step, we investigate the impact of direct democratic institutions and their usage on tax policy and redistribution. The results suggest that the effect of direct democracy on income tax redistribution is a multilayered process. First, the theoretical availability of direct democracy tools does not seem to have the same impact as the effective use of them. Second, fiscal referendums may – in the short term –reduce redistribution through lower tax rates and lead to less tax progression. Third, an increasing number of ballots on initiatives leads to more tax progression and more redistribution in the long run. It seems that the short-term dampening effects of fiscal referendums on redistribution may be overridden in the long run by the expansive effect of popular initiatives. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",income tax schedule and redistribution in direct democracies – the swiss case,2018,Journal of Economic Inequality,"Morger, M., Schaltegger, C.A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Models of distributive politics often assume that fixed budgets constrain the efforts of incumbents to retain power. Yet, significant variation exists in politicians' abilities to push distributive costs forward by funding current fiscal policy through sovereign borrowing. This article theorizes how and when variation in sovereign credit access influences the central goal of democratic incumbents: political survival. Credit allows incumbents to reward supporters without immediately extracting domestic revenue. Excessive borrowing, however, risks higher interest rates or possible market exclusion. Considering sovereign borrowing's benefits and costs, we argue that the marginal effect of credit access on political survival is greatest for those incumbents that require other parties to implement fiscal policy. An analysis of incumbent party tenure in seventy-one democracies from 1977-2007 demonstrates that affordable sovereign finance is associated with longer tenures under divided government but has no significant effect on survival under unified governments. © V.K.

"The virtues of fiscal decentralization are usually assessed against the provision of local public goods; little is said about its impact on public finances. There is a growing concern that public finances may be negatively affected when spending and taxing powers are delegated to subnational tiers of government, especially under adverse financial conditions. Our work proves that these concerns are unfounded. The empirical investigation on 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the period 1980-2010 shows that the budget balances of central and local governments do not get worse with fiscal decentralization. Moreover, during banking crises expenditure decentralization seems to be beneficial, as the central government can easily shift resources from intergovernmental grants to financing public policies necessary to tackle the crisis. In turn, more subnational tax autonomy would improve the budget of all tiers of government, suggesting that more 'effective' tax decentralization increases fiscal discipline also in times of financial distress. © The Author 2017.

"This paper analyzes a multidistrict game of electoral accountability in which constituencies compete over scarce resources by setting expectations for targeted spending. I build a political agency model in which a vote-maximizing politician is subject to the oversight of distinct constituencies. The voters' demand for targeted spending in these constituencies is driven down by the competition among them. In order to make their constituency an attractive choice for discretionary spending, the voters adopt reelection standards below what they receive in equilibrium. They therefore tend to be satisfied with the distributive politics of the incumbent politician.

"Do local policymakers strategically use delay in permitting development to forestall the growth machine? The mantras of smart growth and sustainable development assume local governments can balance the competing values of economic development, ecology, and equity interests in a community.

"In this paper, we develop a neoclassical growth model of market and political power interactions that captures the main features of the economic and political system of Greece and explains the weak economic growth of Greece in the last forty years. The model incorporates the insiders-outsiders labor market structure and the concept of an elite government. Outsiders form a group of workers that supply labor to a competitive private sector. And, insiders form a group of workers that enjoy market power in supplying labor to the public sector and influence the policy decisions of government, including those that affect the development and maintenance of public sector infrastructures. This leads to labor misallocation and inefficient fiscal policies. Thus, even though expanding public sector output has a positive effect on growth, eventually this is counterbalanced by the labor misallocation and inefficient tax policy outcomes leading to a growth reversal phenomenon. The model proposed in this paper may be applicable to other countries that have a similar politicoeconomic structure with Greece, namely other Southern European countries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",market and political power interactions in greece: a theory,2018,European Journal of Political Economy,"Kollintzas, T., Papageorgiou, D., Vassilatos, V.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Despite numerous studies on whether democracy reduces the infant mortality rate (IMR), the empirical results remain mixed at best. In this article, I perform several theoretical and empirical exercises that help explain why and under what conditions we should expect politics to matter most for a decrease in IMR. First, I capitalize on the epidemiological view that IMR – the most commonly used indicator of health in social sciences – is better suited to reflect public health micromanagement than overall social development. Second, I theorize that autocrats have incentives to invest in health up to a certain point, which could lead to a reduction in IMR. Third, I introduce an omitted variable – good governance – that trumps the importance of a political regime for IMR: (1) it directly affects public health micromanagement, and (2) many autocrats made inroads in achieving good governance. Finally, for the first time in such research, I use a disaggregated IMR approach to corroborate my hypotheses. © The Author(s) 2018.",political economy of infant mortality rate: role of democracy versus good governance,2018,International Journal of Health Services,"Rosenberg, D.Y.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Research Summary: This study examines whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) improves firms’ competitiveness in the market for government procurement contracts. To obtain exogenous variation in firms’ social engagement, I exploit a quasi-natural experiment provided by the enactment of state-level constituency statutes, which allow directors to consider stakeholders’ interests when making business decisions. Using constituency statutes as instrumental variable (IV) for CSR, I find that companies with higher CSR receive more procurement contracts. The effect is stronger for more complex contracts and in the early years of the government-company relationship, suggesting that CSR helps mitigate information asymmetries by signaling trustworthiness. Moreover, the effect is stronger in competitive industries, indicating that CSR can serve as a differentiation strategy to compete against other bidders. Managerial Summary: This study examines how companies can strategically improve their competitiveness in the market for government procurement contracts—a market of economic importance (15–20% of GDP). It shows that companies with higher social and environmental performance (CSR) receive more procurement contracts. This effect is stronger for more complex contracts, in the early years of the government–company relationship, and in more competitive industries. These findings indicate that firms’ CSR can serve as a signaling and differentiation strategy that influences the purchasing decision of government agencies. Accordingly, managers operating in the business-to-government (B2G) sector could benefit from integrating social and environmental considerations into their strategic decision making.

"I develop models in which a minimum winning coalition decides on the level of government spending, where the Coase theorem holds amongst members of the winning coalition. An increase in the supermajority requirement has potentially conflicting effects on spending. A higher requirement increases the tax price internalized by the minimum winning coalition, but also increases the number of districts included in this coalition. I develop separate models in which the spending in question consists of (i) a nonexcludable good, (ii) a distributive consumption good, (iii) infrastructure spending and (iv) a transfer payment. A supermajority rule has no effect on spending for nonexcludable goods and ambiguous effects on spending for distributive projects and infrastructure spending. An increased supermajority requirement does unambiguously reduce transfer spending. I also relate the supermajority rule to the law of 1/n. If the Coase Theorem holds and a minimum winning coalition forms, an increase in the number of districts n has precisely the same effect on overall expenditure as a decrease in the supermajority requirement. Thus, the ambiguous spending effects stemming from supermajority rule carry over into this version of the law of 1/n. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","supermajority rule, the law of 1/n, and government spending: a synthesis",2018,Public Choice,"Pecorino, P.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",60
"Distributive politics and spatial equity: the allocation of public investment in Chile. Regional Studies.

Drawing upon panel data, it shows that investment is mediated by pork-barrel and political budget cycles, as well as favouring the relatively better-off areas. Estimations also reveal that resources are channelled to the municipalities where the vote margin in local elections is larger, whereas national results are not relevant, indicating that local governments’ lobbying capacity is prioritized over national electoral interests. Based on these results, the implications for regional governance and for reducing the margin of arbitrary allocations are discussed. © 2017 Regional Studies Association.",distributive politics and spatial equity: the allocation of public investment in chile,2018,Regional Studies,"Livert, F., Gainza, X.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",61
"The literature on gender has attempted to explain the differences between the public outcome depending on whether the ruler is male or female, on the basis that men and women have different preferences. This scientific research has not yet examined issues related to fiscal crises, and our research aims to fill this gap. In a context of generalised economic crisis, our research examines if the gender of the mayor affected the fiscal adjustment policies carried out by municipalities with fiscal deficits in the Spanish region of Galicia. Our paper suggests that although gender of the mayor does not seem to have affected the level of adjustment in total current expenditure, it does seem to have influenced the way in which social and non-social spending were adjusted. Our study also highlights that female mayors are associated with lower levels of tax revenues and this could slow the adjustment processes of fiscal imbalances. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adjustments in municipal fiscal crises. are they different according to the gender of the mayor?,2018,Local Government Studies,"Cabaleiro Casal, R., Buch Gómez, E.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"While a number of different studies have explored the effects of budgetary procedures and the centralization of the budget process on government debt, deficits and spending, few of them have explored whether such fiscal institutions matter for public revenue. This article argues that centralizing the budget process raises the levels of taxation by limiting the ability of individual government officials to veto tax increases in line with common-pool-problem arguments regarding public finances. Using detailed data on budgetary procedures from 15 EU countries, the empirical analysis shows that greater centralization of the budget process increases taxation as a share of GDP and that both the type of budget centralization and level of government fractionalization matter for the size of this effect. The results suggest that further centralizing the budget process limits government debt and deficits by increasing public revenues as well as constraining public spending. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",budget institutions and taxation,2018,Public Choice,"Aaskoven, L.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",63
"Will politics lead to over-building or under-building of transportation projects? In this paper, we develop a model of infrastructure policy in which politicians overdo things that have hidden costs and underperform tasks whose costs voters readily perceive. Consequently, national funding of transportation leads to overspending, since voters more readily perceive the upside of new projects than the future taxes that will be paid for distant highways. Yet when local voters are well-informed, the highly salient nuisances of local construction, including land taking and noise, lead to under-building. This framework explains the decline of urban mega-projects in the US (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003) as the result of increasingly educated and organized urban voters. Our framework also predicts more per capita transportation spending in low-density and less educated areas, which seems to be empirically correct. © 2017 The Authors",the political economy of transportation investment,2018,Economics of Transportation,"Glaeser, E.L., Ponzetto, G.A.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We develop a theory of taxation and the distribution of government spending in a citizen-candidate model of legislatures. Individuals are heterogeneous in two dimensions: productive ability in the private sector and negotiating ability in politics. When these are positively correlated, rich voters always prefer a rich legislator, but poor voters face a trade-off. A rich legislator will secure more pork for the district, but will also prefer lower taxation than the poor voter. Our theory organizes a number of stylized facts across countries about taxation and redistribution, parties, and class representation in legislatures. We demonstrate that spending does not necessarily increase when the number of legislators increases, as the standard common-pool intuition suggests, and that many policies aimed at increasing descriptive representation may have the opposite effect. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",the right type of legislator: a theory of taxation and representation,2018,Journal of Public Economics,"Mattozzi, A., Snowberg, E.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",65
"A cost–benefit analysis of terrorist attacks is developed and placed within a systematic theoretical structure. For the target or object of the attack, we consider the lost value of human lives, lost economic value, and lost influence value, counted as benefits for the terrorist. The corresponding losses for the terrorist are counted as costs. The terrorist attacks if benefits outweigh costs. Bounded rationality is enabled where the three kinds of benefits and costs can be weighted differently. We account for two ex ante probabilities of successful planning and attack, and enable the terrorist to assign different weights to its multiple stakeholders. We introduce multiple time periods, time discounting, attitudes towards risk, and subcategories for the benefits and costs.

"Why do governments employ inefficient policies when more efficient ones are available for the same purpose? We address this puzzle in the context of redistribution toward special interest groups (SIGs) by focusing on a set of important policies: tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our policy choice model a government can gain by committing to constrain tariffs through international agreements even if this leads to the use of less efficient NTBs; commitment has political value because it improves the bargaining position of a government that is weak relative to domestic SIGs. Using detailed data we find support for several of the model's predictions including: (i) tariff commitments in trade agreements increase the likelihood and restrictiveness of NTBs but not enough to offset the original tariff reductions; (ii) tariff commitments are more likely to be adopted and more stringent when the government is weaker relative to a SIG. Thus, the results can explain the use of inefficient policies for redistribution and suggest that the bargaining motive is an important source of the political value of commitment in international agreements. © 2019 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

"The election of Donald Trump in 2016 has renewed concerns about nonrational decision making in American government. One view of the decision-making process, bounded rationality, is that decisions by managers in public agencies must be based on rational attempts to achieve policy goals. In opposition, advocates of successive limited comparisons argue that rationality, so conceived, is too often impossible to achieve in practice, and that better results can be attained through muddling through. Those who do not trust “technocrats” to make policy decisions would prefer that they be made with more political input than would be provided under an attempt to approximate rationality. This article offers an argument that in order to serve the public interest as envisioned by the designers of our institutions, American democracy mandates that public organizations base their policy decisions on a rational analysis of causal relations between the policy and the underlying behavior that is the object of the policy. This argument is based on reflections on the foundational writings of John Locke and James Madison advancing the use of reason to manage inevitable conflict in democratic societies and, in so doing, to achieve the public good. © 2018, © 2018 American Society for Public Administration.",does democracy entail an obligation to make rational policy decisions? the muddling through vs. bounded rationality debate through a lockean and madisonian lens,2018,Public Integrity,"Reed, R., Curtis, C., Lovrich, N.P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We find that the adoption of numerical fiscal rules reduces government borrowing costs in a sample of 101 advanced and developing countries for 1985–2010. We apply a variety of propensity score matching methods to address the self-selection problem of policy adoption and find strong evidence that fiscal rules have large and significant treatment effects on lowering government borrowing costs in both international and domestic financial markets. The results are robust to changes in country sample and alternative estimation methodology, and are consistent with fiscal rules helping to build policy credibility by reducing the probability of default and the “risk premium” on government debt that compensates lenders for this possibility.

"What is the influence of the rules of political representation on local spending? This research tests the law of 1/n in the Portuguese local context and finds that the law fails to apply. We suggest an alternative measure—the density of representation—to assess the impact of the rules of city council representation on local public expenditures. Density of representation is defined as the number of elected officials in the city council divided by city population. We find an S-shaped relationship between the density of representation and the level of local government expenditures. The level of municipal spending initially declines with increases in the density of representation, reflecting an increase in the ability of constituents to monitor their elected representatives. At higher levels of representation density, the relationship becomes positive, suggesting that the dynamics of the budgetary commons become salient. The relationship becomes negative again for extremely high density of representation owing to increases in the transaction costs of legislative decision-making.

"The State has two essential tools to achieve the goal of macroeconomics stability, monetary policy and fiscal policy. However, the progress in terms of behavioral rules has been greater in the case of monetary policy. This article aims to make a contribution in relation to the mechanism that should be followed by a fiscal rule to promote a counter-cyclical behavior, without questioning the solvency of the public sector. To do so, the flexibility of the rule is fundamental, through a proper selection of its base and a clear and transparent escape clause. Once described its desirable characteristics, a generic fiscal rule is proposed, which has to be adapted to each particular case. This is done for the case of Spain in the years prior to the last crisis. Finally, it is concluded that a well-designed fiscal rule can be really useful not only for purposes of solvency and stability but also as a guide for discretion. © 2018 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Contaduría y Administración.",a generic fiscal rule: proposal and design [propuesta y diseño de una regla fiscal genérica],2018,Contaduria y Administracion,"Zack, G., Sotelsek, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Why do rich countries flirt with fiscal disaster? Between the 1970s and the 2000s, during times of peace and prosperity, affluent countries—like Belgium, Greece, Italy, and Japan—accumulated so much debt that they became vulnerable and exposed themselves to the risk of default. In the past three decades, an extensive scholarly consensus emerged that these problems were created by fiscal indiscipline, the lack of sufficient concern for budgetary constraints from policy makers as they try to please voters. This approach formed the foundation for the fiscal surveillance system that attempted to bring borrowing in European countries under control via a set of fiscal rules. In the Red demonstrates that the problem of sustained, large-scale debt accumulation is an adjustment issue rather than a governance failure. Irrespective of whether the original impetus for borrowing arose from exogenous changes or irresponsible decision making, policy makers invariably initiate spending cuts and/or tax increases when debt grows at an alarming rate for several years in a row. Zsófia Barta argues that explaining why some countries accumulate substantial amounts of debt for decades hinges on understanding the conditions required to allow policy makers to successfully put into place painful adjustment measures. © 2018 by Zsófia Barta.

"What is the effect of legislature size on public spending? An answer to this question is provided by Weingast et al. (J Polit Econ 89(4):642–664, 1981), whose “law of 1/n” posits that an increase in the number of elected representatives always leads to an increase in public spending. Because elected politicians regard the tax base as a common pool from which they can finance specific projects for their constituencies, and these specific constituencies internalize the full benefits of the projects, but only bear a fraction of the costs (projects are financed from the common tax base), fiscal inefficiency will increase with the number of representatives. In this paper, I test the validity of the “law of 1/n” using a dataset of 9325 German municipalities between 2008 and 2010. Through the application of a regression discontinuity design, many of the methodological pitfalls of previous studies can be avoided and a valid estimation of the causal effect of legislature size on public spending for German municipalities can be determined. The results do not corroborate the positive findings of previous studies, which generally supported the implications of the “law of 1/n”. For the years 2008–2010, I find a negative effect of legislature size on public spending in German municipal councils. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",the effect of legislature size on public spending: evidence from a regression discontinuity design,2017,Public Choice,"Höhmann, D.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,82
"Based on basic organizational theories, this paper revisits studies about intergovernmental relationships in China and proposes a systematic explanation framework from the perspective of the allocation mechanism of authority and accountability. The institutional feature of government organization is unfolded from two dimensions, authority and accountability. In China, the authority and accountability of different hierarchies are strongly related but not clearly defined. Theories such as “Federalism, Chinese Style” are the basis for different conditions. The trade-off between control and incentive, specification, and coordination should be given more consideration with optimal analyses. As the main accountability practicing mechanism, Cadre management from upper-layer hierarchies greatly affects the allocation mechanism between different hierarchies. However, the tournament theory about promotion lacks vision, empirical bases, and explanation power.

"Development projects like schools and latrines are popular with politicians and voters alike, yet many developing countries are littered with half-finished projects that were abandoned mid-construction. Using an original database of over 14,000 small development projects in Ghana, I estimate that one-third of projects that start are never completed, consuming nearly one-fifth of all local government investment. I develop a theory of project noncompletion as the outcome of a dynamically inconsistent collective choice process among political actors facing commitment problems in contexts of limited resources. I find evidence consistent with key predictions of this theory, but inconsistent with alternative explanations based on corruption or clientelism. I show that fiscal institutions can increase completion rates by mitigating the operational consequences of these collective choice failures.

"It is shown that the joint distribution of economic and political power plays a key role in determining regulatory and tax policies of national and subnational governments. If both economic and political power are evenly distributed across individuals, then regulatory and tax policies are efficient, but if they are unevenly distributed and positively correlated, then regulatory policy is used by subnational governments to redistribute income in favor of individuals with higher economic and political power at the expense of productivity and output. Consequently, the national government has to raise the tax rate to finance public expenditure. Moreover, if there exists a positive correlation between economic and political power, then the higher the fiscal gap, the larger the gap between equilibrium and efficient policies because subnational governments underestimate more the fall of public revenues caused by inefficient policies. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",regulation and rent-seeking: the role of the distribution of political and economic power,2017,Journal of Public Economic Theory,"Rio, F.D., Lores, F.-X.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",87

"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a fiscal common pool problem in Japanese municipal mergers. Specifically, we investigate whether the merged municipalities rapidly increase their expenditures and bonds just before mergers. Because the likelihood of Japanese municipal mergers depends on a municipality's characteristics such as population size, area, and fiscal conditions, municipal mergers are a non-voluntary and non-random phenomenon in Japan. Therefore, we identify causal effects by applying propensity score matching within a differences-in-differences framework to address the problems of endogeneity bias and sample selection bias. In particular, we focus on the subordinate merger partner in absorption-type mergers. Our results show that the subordinate merger partner suffers from adverse fiscal conditions and creates a fiscal common pool problem in public projects just before mergers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",evaluation of the fiscal effect on municipal mergers: quasi-experimental evidence from japanese municipal data,2017,Regional Science and Urban Economics,"Hirota, H., Yunoue, H.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",90

"This research examines the effects of three defining features of bureaucratic organizations – hierarchy, centralization of decision-making, and the formalization of administrative procedures and rules – on the fiscal health of city governments in the US. It utilizes data from a national survey of top appointed city officials in the US to measure the bureaucratic features of city governments, and assesses budgetary solvency using actual financial data from audited financial reports. Using factor analysis to develop a composite bureaucracy index, and addressing unobserved heterogeneity and possible simultaneity bias through least squares dummy variable regression and instrumental variable regression, the empirical analysis shows that excessive bureaucracy leads to poorer fiscal health.

"This paper explores economic, political and institutional determinants of discretionary fiscal policy in 11 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries from 2000 to 2013 and compares discretionary fiscal reactions before and during the global economic crisis. We find that fiscal policy was procyclical to the output gap both before and during the crisis, while no fiscal reaction to the absorption gap was captured. Our results also indicate a negative relationship between the level of public debt and deficits over the entire period and the pre-crisis period, suggesting that rising public debt represented a brake on future deficits. We also find that election cycles affect the fiscal deficit, but only during the pre-crisis period, while no evidence of a relationship between fiscal policy and government fragmentation was captured. We find some evidence that in the pre-crisis period the CEE countries with a fixed exchange rate regime ran lower deficits than those with a floating regime, whereas during the crisis no impact of the exchange rate regime on the fiscal deficit was found. There is also some evidence that an arrangement with the IMF was associated with lower deficits for the entire sample period. However, no impact of EU accession on the fiscal stance was identified. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",determinants of discretionary fiscal policy in central and eastern europe,2017,Economic Systems,"Arsic, M., Nojkovic, A., Randjelovic, S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",93

"How do electoral institutions affect legislative behavior? Though a large body of theoretical scholarship posits a negative relationship between multimember districting and the provision of particularistic goods, empirical scholarship has found little evidence in support of this expectation. Using data on the provision of US post offices from 1876 to 1896, a period during which many states elected congressional representatives from at-large districts, and a differences-in-differences approach, I find that counties represented by at-large representatives received approximately 8% fewer post offices.

"Higher wages in agglomerations often do not reflect an increase in purchasing power, because a high percentage of the wage increase has to be spend on housing. Thus, after housing is considered taxpayers may have identical disposable incomes, although gross as well as after-tax income may differ. This unequal treatment of taxpayers is due to the taxation of nominal incomes. If tax systems taxed income based on regionally adjusted purchasing power, horizontal equity would be assured. Since this is an unfeasible option, the differences could be corrected by allowing a deduction on housing costs. Given the large revenue losses, it seems unlikely that governments in OECD countries move to a system where rents are deductible in determining taxable income. Another alternative—taxation of potentially achievable income—is unfeasible due to political opposition. A final and less costly alternative is fiscal federalism. Granting autonomy to the lower levels of the government offers local governments the power to design the tax system in a way that reflects differences in living costs. Although this option does not necessarily imply that governments effectively design the tax schedule in that way, a comparison of Germany and Switzerland shows that governments are aware of these differences across regions. The paper concludes that granting tax autonomy to the lower tiers in Germany would make many citizens, especially in the Southern part, better off and would promote horizontal equity among German taxpayers. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",federalism and horizontal equity across switzerland and germany: a new rationale for a decentralized fiscal structure,2017,Constitutional Political Economy,"Schwarz, P.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",96
"This article examines the relationship between council size and municipal expenditures in Quebec's largest municipalities. Two claims commonly found in the literature are tested: the professionalization and the law of 1/n hypotheses. Using cross-sectional data, the professionalization hypothesis is confirmed: each elected official costs more in a smaller council. As for the law of 1/n, the effect of council size on total government expenditures is not significant. These results refute the cost saving argument for smaller councils and suggest that other aspects, such as quality of democratic life and efficiency in decision-making, may be more relevant to the debate. © The Institute of Public Administration of Canada/L'Institut d'administration publique du Canada 2017",a sizeable effect? municipal council size and the cost of local government in canada,2017,Canadian Public Administration,"Meloche, J.-P., Kilfoil, P.",Scopus,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,97
"Do coalition governments really suffer from short time horizons in fiscal policymaking, as posited by standard political-economy models? This article focusses on coalitions that have created high levels of familiarity through shared governing experiences in the past and that are likely to cooperate again in future governing coalitions. I argue that such coalitions have incentives to internalise the future costs of debt accumulation and reach credible agreements to balance their constituencies' fiscal preferences. Moreover, sustaining broad coalitions should have electoral advantages to implementing controversial economic reforms, thus resulting in lower debt increases compared not only with less durable coalitions but also with single-party governments. Comparing 36 economically advanced democracies between (up to) 1962 and 2013, I estimate the effects of coalitions' cooperation prospects on the dynamics of public debt.

"There is an extensive literature analysing the executive branch within local U.S. government jurisdictions. This has largely revolved around the differences between elected mayors and appointed city managers. Much of the academic work has considered the potential efficiency gains that may be associated with either form of government and comparative analyses between the two. However, the empirical literature has been divided regarding the relative efficiency of either form. This article attempts to add to that literature by considering how bond markets may perceive potential efficiencies that emerge from one executive type over the other by evaluating bond ratings for a sample of large municipal governments in the United States. Overall, the results suggest that municipalities headed by a city manager are associated with increased bond ratings (and thus lower borrowing costs), which may lend support that this form of administration is, on some margin, relatively more efficient than others. These results are robust to a number of specifications. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",local government type and municipal bond ratings: what’s the relationship?,2017,Applied Economics,"Dove, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"After the Chinese central government announced a policy of raising retirement benefits in 2005, there ensued a race to the top in pension benefit growth among its 31 provincial units. This study seeks to explain how this seemingly unusual nationwide social welfare expansion came about in authoritarian China. It helps to open up the black box of mysterious Chinese politics. The study highlights the roles of sub-national governments in decentralized Chinese social welfare policymaking. Instead of treating authoritarian rulers as unitary actors, this study looks into the interplay of center and provinces in a decentralized authoritarian political system. Compared with the center, provinces have traditionally been more reluctant to devote economic resources to social welfare. To motivate provincial governments to implement a policy of increased benefits, the center granted fiscal subsidies to certain provinces. This special subsidy program had three effects: (1) it reduced the provincial costs of the benefit increase; (2) it elevated the center’s annual fiscal transfer base for subsidized provincial governments beyond the current year, into the future; and (3) it increased disposable personal income, a key indicator of local government officials’ political merits in the cadre evaluation system. Inter-provincial competition in raising retirement benefits is explained, first, by provinces’ desires to earn greater fiscal subsidies from the center; and, second, by the efforts of those provinces which did not receive the subsidies to keep their benefit levels up with the levels of those which did. The result of the center’s subsidy program was not only a rise in pension levels, but also an increase in inter-regional social welfare disparities. The central government, perhaps alarmed by the consequences of its policy, acted to bring the rapid expansion of pension levels to an apparent end in 2016. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",inter-regional competition in retirement benefit growth-the role of the sub-national government in authoritarian china,2017,Journal of Contemporary China,"Lin, J., Dale Tussing, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Local government systems across the world face acute and ongoing fiscal challenges. In Australia, the regulatory response has focused squarely on council consolidation. This has, unfortunately, meant that comparatively little attention has been paid to alternate, less disruptive methods for enhancing municipal sustainability. One such possibility lies in modifying the structure of local political representation. We conduct a number of estimations on a four-year panel of Victorian municipal data to test whether the “law of 1/n” has empirical support at the local government level. Our results clearly show that the number of geographically defined fragments, or wards, within a given municipality is a statistically significant determinant of local government expenditure. A number of public policy recommendations follow from the empirical evidence that might be broadly applicable to other municipal systems. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",the price of democracy? political representation structure and per capita expenditure in victorian local government,2017,Urban Affairs Review,"Drew, J., Dollery, B.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,102
"This paper explores the institutional change introduced by the public disclosure of an education development index (IDEB, Basic Education Development Index) in 2007 to identify the effect of education accountability on yardstick competition in educational spending among Brazilian municipalities. An exploratory analysis of the data shows a minor reduction (20%) in spatial interaction in public educational spending after IDEB disclosure—compared with the spatial correlation before disclosure of the index. Our main results explore a discontinuity around the cutoff of 30 students enrolled in the grade under assessment after IDEB disclosure. The estimates suggest that the spatial autocorrelation—and, thus, yardstick competition—is reduced by 52%. Falsification and robustness tests were performed and suggest that we can claim causality around small bandwidths of the cutoff.

"We investigate how term limits for mayors influence central government transfers to municipalities. Estimates are based on a dataset of Italian cities over the 1998–2010 period. To credibly identify the influence of term limits, our estimations include mayor fixed effects. We also consider intra-term differences in intergovernmental grants. We provide evidence that electoral incentives distort rather than discipline incumbent mayors’ behavior because transfers are higher before an election with an eligible incumbent, in line with the political budget cycle literature. This evidence is also consistent with the idea that the allocation of intergovernmental grants is influenced by lobbying on the part of eligible local government officeholders, as in Borck and Owings (2003). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",term limits for mayors and intergovernmental grants: evidence from italian cities,2017,Regional Science and Urban Economics,"Dalle Nogare, C., Kauder, B.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Subnational governments devote a significant share of their financial resources to help municipalities provide local public services to their citizens. Compared to the large number of studies on national governments, little effort has been devoted to the influence of distributive politics on the use of intergovernmental grants by subnational governments. To fill this gap, this study uses a data set covering the period 2001–2011 to verify to what extent the Québec government used conditional grants to municipalities for electoral purposes. The results of this study show that the allocation of grants to municipalities is not exempt from electoral politics as municipalities located in districts held by governing parties or in high electoral competition districts receive more grants than other municipalities. However, the influence of electoral politics decreases substantially when the management of intergovernmental grants is under tight scrutiny by the opposition parties, mass media and the population. These findings suggest that distributive politics can be conceptualised as a political agency problem whose prevalence is seriously constrained by the improvement of the transparency of public policies management. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",the use of intergovernmental grants to municipalities for electoral purposes by subnational governments,2017,Local Government Studies,"Mehiriz, K.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",105

Focusing on WTO disputes filed by the United States during the 1995–2014 period, we find that U.S. presidents are more likely to initiate a dispute in the year preceding their re-election. Moreover, U.S. trade disputes are more likely to involve industries that are important in swing states.

"This article analyses the factors that seem to play an important role in determining the cost of sovereign debt. Specifically, we evaluate to what extent transparency, the level of corruption, citizens’ trust in politicians and credit ratings affect interest rates. For that purpose, we create a transparency index matching the 2007 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/World Bank Budgeting Database items with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Best Practices for Budget Transparency sections. We also check our assumptions with the International Budget Partnership’s Open Budget Index and with a non-linear transformation of our index. Furthermore, we use several control variables for a sample of 103 countries in the year 2008. Our results show that better fiscal transparency, political trust and credit ratings are connected with a lower cost of sovereign debt. Finally, as expected, higher corruption, budget deficits, current account deficits and unemployment make sovereign interest rates increase. Points for practitioners: The key implications for professionals working in public management and administration are twofold. First, despite the criticism raised by credit ratings, it is clear that poorer ratings are connected with higher financing costs for governments. Therefore, governments should enhance those indicators that impact the credit rating of their sovereign debt. Second, governments should seek to be more transparent, since transparency reduces uncertainty about the degree of cheating, improves decision-making and therefore decreases the cost of debt. Transparency reduces information asymmetries between governments and financial markets, which, in turn, diminishes the spread requested by investors. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",fiscal transparency and the cost of sovereign debt,2017,International Review of Administrative Sciences,"Bastida, F., Guillamón, M.-D., Benito, B.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Reducing public spending was a major objective when governments across Europe increasingly turned to outsourcing as a mode of public service provision from the 1980s. Today, despite its prevalence, there is still little consensus in the literature on whether outsourcing is an effective policy as regards reducing spending. Using a panel data model for 25 European countries over the period 1990–2011, this article tests whether outsourcing actually led to a reduction in public spending. Results indicate that outsourcing failed to reduce government expenditures at the central government level.

"This article studies the causal effect of electoral systems on fiscal outcomes using an empirical design exploiting a discontinuity in the application of electoral rules in Polish municipalities in the period 2002–2014. In that period, municipalities followed either majoritarian or proportional (PR) systems, depending on the population size. The article provides evidence that the PR system results in smaller municipalities’ own revenue, larger intergovernmental transfers and, consequently, greater vertical fiscal imbalance. It is demonstrated that the reduction in own revenue under the PR system is arguably driven by lower accountability of policy-makers, which leads to lower effort of policy-makers in stimulating local labour markets and entrepreneurship. An increase in intergovernmental grants, in turn, can be explained by a larger share of incumbents affiliated with national political parties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",electoral systems and fiscal policy outcomes: evidence from poland,2017,European Journal of Political Economy,"Kantorowicz, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",109
"American cities have become a battleground for civil rights struggles between law enforcement officials and the residents they are sworn to protect. A number of voices have emerged from this conflict, calling for reform of local policing and strategies for litigation-based measures for restitution and deterrence. And yet relatively unnoticed are the very local governments meant to secure, support, and protect the safety and interests of their residents. This inattention is especially troubling given the barriers to litigation alone as a solution. And this challenge is exacerbated by the latent, systemic, and structural defects that give rise to civil rights violations and minority underrepresentation in our cities. This Note seeks to shift our attention to institutional reform of local government. Particularly, it asks us to revisit the ways in which we have constrained our cities’ mayors and, in doing so, proposes a cautious return to empowered municipal executives as instigators, allies, and advocates for civil rights. This Note presents a novel, close examination of executive mayoral governance. It explains how shifting the balance and separation of powers in local government can prove a measure of self-help for cities. Drawing upon jurisprudence, legal theory, case studies, and political science, this Note explains how a strong executive in cities can harness and strengthen traditional tools for reform-from Department of Justice § 14141 litigation and settlements to greater racial diversity in law enforcement to civil disobedience. Though neither a panacea for all ills nor a fit for all instances, a strong mayor can serve as an elemental linchpin for legal improvements in how our cities prevent, handle, and heal from law enforcement violations of civil rights. © 2017, Stanford Law School.

"Despite the extensive literature on distributive politics, there is still is a lack of a theory of how political and fiscal institutions interact to shape the pork barreling ability of national leaders in a federal parliamentary democracy. This article examines how the party system types (dominant party versus coalition system) and particular attributes of discretionary grants (providing credit claiming opportunity or facilitating side payments) influence opportunities for pork-barrel politics. This article proposes a situational theory of distributive politics that states that incentives for exclusive targeting of affiliated states in one-party dominant systems drive national ruling parties toward particularism while the shrinking opportunity to indulge in such a policy in multiparty coalition systems creates a universalization effect. The disaggregated analysis of discretionary grants using Indian data for 14 states for the one-party dominant period (1972–89) and the coalition era (1996–2012) confirms the theoretical expectations. Additionally, the exercise brings to the fore the fact that the shift from particularism to universalism occurs for schematic grants that provide credit claiming opportunity.

"Public Administration is forced to strike a balance between efficiency and democracy in defining its agenda and course of action. One of the characteristics of Public Administration is that all decisions must reflect democratic values, in addition to being efficient.

Do state officials exploit this discretion to channel housing subsidies to geographic constituencies for political ends?

"A view prominently expounded is that the interaction between the composition and the volume of public expenditures is directly affected by political, institutional, psephological and ideological indicators. A crucial component of public expenditures, social expenditures play an important role in the economy as they directly and indirectly affect the distribution of income and wealth. Social expenditures aim at reallocating income and wealth unequal distribution. These expenditures comprise cash benefits, direct in-kind provision of goods and services, and tax breaks with social purposes.

"A common interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity in the federalism literature is that decentralized government, which is closer to the people, is better able to respond to the preferences of its citizens. However, when the principle is denuded of its moral foundations in this fashion it not only fails to provide the grounding for achieving human dignity and the common good, but may also become the harbinger of fiscal crises and social dysfunction. We provide a more comprehensive account of the principle of subsidiarity and contrast this with various conceptions prominently presented in the federalism literature.We then explore how this more comprehensive view of subsidiarity would look in practice.

"This paper examines which economic, institutional and political characteristics of countries affect the likelihood that a numeral rule will be adopted as part of a fiscal strategy to limit the level of public debt. We estimate a panel binary response model over the period 1970–2012 for 110 countries, of which 58 opted to adopt such a rule. Our results suggest that the probability such a rule will be adopted is greater if a country has a high level of public debt, a relatively inflexible exchange rate regime, has already adopted inflation targeting, has deep credit markets and if other countries already have adopted a debt rule. There are some differences in decision factors between high-income and lower income countries, with the level of economic development and the openness of the economy playing opposite roles in each country group, and the impact of monetary unions on debt rule adoption being much stronger in the former group.

A feature of this approach is that generally normative considerations form only a latent element of the discussions, which is invariably anchored in debates about institutional design rather than the normative defensibility of local government. The book addresses this point by providing an account of the terrain of theoretical debate alongside salient themes in public policy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","local government in australia: history, theory and public policy",2017,"Local Government in Australia: History, Theory and Public Policy","Grant, B., Drew, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Often described as a public policy “bible,” Weimer and Vining remains the essential primer it ever was. Now in its sixth edition, Policy Analysis provides a strong conceptual foundation of the rationales for and the limitations to public policy. It offers practical advice about how to do policy analysis, but goes a bit deeper to demonstrate the application of advanced analytical techniques through the use of case studies. Updates to this edition include: A chapter dedicated to distinguishing between policy analysis, policy research, stakeholder analysis, and research about the policy process. An extensively updated chapter on policy problems as market and governmental failure that explores the popularity of Uber and its consequences. The presentation of a property rights perspective in the chapter on government supply to help show the goal tensions that arise from mixed ownership. An entirely new chapter on performing analysis from the perspective of a public agency and a particular program within the agency’s portfolio: public agency strategic analysis (PASA). A substantially rewritten chapter on cost-benefit analysis, to better prepare students to become producers and consumers of the types of cost-benefit analyses they will encounter in regulatory analysis and social policy careers.

"We analyse how the presence of an incumbent among candidates at an election affects electoral turnout. We use a rich data set which provides information on the results of Italian municipal elections over the period 1993–2011. We find that the impact of incumbency is heterogeneous across geographical areas: incumbency produces a positive effect on turnout in the South of Italy, whereas we find a negative and statistically significant effect in the North. We speculate that the north-south divergence is related to differences in social capital and in clientelistic relationships established by incumbent politicians. Our conjecture finds support when we look separately at municipalities in the lower and upper quartile of the social capital distribution and at municipalities with high or low densities of organised crime. © 2016",the impact of incumbency on turnout. evidence from italian municipalities,2016,Electoral Studies,"De Benedetto, M.A., De Paola, M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We investigate whether politicians award intergovernmental grants to core supporters. Our new dataset contains information on discretionary project grants from a German state government to municipalities over the period 2008–2011. The results show that discretionary grants were awarded to municipalities with many core supporters of the incumbent state government. Discretionary grants per capita increased by about 1.4 percent when the vote share of the incumbent party in the state election increased by one percentage point. The fiscal capacity of a municipality does, by contrast, not predict the level of discretionary grants.

"This paper carries out a long-run reconstruction of a discontinuous time series of net fiscal flows for Italian regions and macro-regions from 1951 to 2010. This evidence is the basis to put forward an assessment on the intensity of interregional redistribution operated by public sector. The main result of the paper is that even if the amount of resources transferred to Southern Italy from the rest of the country has been significant and increasing over time (at least up to the end of the 1990s), redistribution cannot be judged disproportionately large, in the light of income differences among regions, the public commitment in regional policies and the constitutional principles of equal access of citizens to the basic public services. Secondly, historical analysis of data and inspection of facts indicate that the relationship between the intensity of interregional redistribution and the financial effort of regional policies is weak. This supports the view that increasing NFFs have little served the purpose of regional convergence; rather, the rise of imbalances seems to be mainly connected to the overall escalation of public expenditure, following the institutional break occurred in mid-1970s with the establishment of Regional Governments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",net fiscal flows and interregional redistribution in italy: a long-run perspective (1951-2010),2016,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,"Giannola, A., Petraglia, C., Scalera, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Public-policy assumptions regarding sub-national governments' financial behavior are based on economic rationality. Therefore, to achieve fiscal stability at the macro level, central governments use fiscal rules both to constrain the behavior of local policymakers and to resolve deficit/debt biases. Using the Italian fiscal governance system as an illustrative example, this chapter considers both the tensions derived from achieving fiscal responsibility at the national level in a decentralized environment and the difficulties of maintaining adequate performance at the local government level. It is argued that the public management perspective can be helpful not only at the micro level but also at the macro level in developing public policies to promote fiscal stability. It is suggested that public policy should adopt a more holistic approach toward fiscal responsibility in multi-level governance environments. Such an approach requires a deep understanding of the determinants of financial viability of public sector organizations. © 2017 by IGI Global.

"Pork barrel spending is typically attributed to the strategic behavior of political elites hoping to be electorally rewarded by voters residing in their districts. Such behavior is expected to depend on the incentives imposed by the electoral system. We estimate the causal effect of local representation in a closed-list proportional representation system where individual candidates have no clear electoral incentive to favor their hometown. Using data from Norwegian regional governments, we still find a hometown bias. We document that municipalities with a representative on the regional council from the same party as the regional governor tend to obtain more funding for local investments. Citizens also tend to vote more often for parties whose gubernatorial candidate is from their own hometown, consistent with expectations of particularistic benefits. A possible explanation is that regional council members are often recruited from local politics and remain loyal to their roots. We find no evidence that regional council experience affects politicians’ future career prospects at the local level. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",local favoritism in at-large proportional representation systems,2016,Journal of Public Economics,"Fiva, J.H., Halse, A.H.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",127
"We developed a simple model on publicly provided private goods, such as health or education that highlights a vicious cycle faced by many developing countries. When public services are not of high quality due to mismanagement or corruption, the wealthy may switch to private alternatives. Their exit weakens the influence of citizen voice over politicians, since that leaves the poor as the only constituent with a stake in good governance. As the civic control over local governments weakens, government’s concern for social welfare declines even further, leading to more corruption and more corrosion in the quality of public services. Our model shows that establishing institutions (such as local taxation) that spread the costs and benefits of governance across the whole society is crucial for the success of local governments.

"Amalgamation incentivizes municipalities to increase public debt because it allows them to subrogate their repayment and interest burden on the entire municipality after amalgamation. Smaller municipalities, in particular, tend to accumulate public debt in order to free-ride. Previous studies have shown this kind of opportunistic behavior in countries where municipalities can issue bonds freely in the market. However, in Japan, municipalities cannot issue bonds freely by regulation. When such regulation controls debt accumulation by the merging municipality, the free-rider effect should be weak. This study examines the relationship between the regulation of local government borrowing and free-rider behavior of Japanese municipalities. The difference-in-difference regression results confirm the existence of a free-rider effect in this regard. Moreover, the debt expenditure ratio, the index of the regulation of local public bond issues, has the same effect that prevents local public debt from increasing for both merging and never-merged municipalities. This fact shows that a merging municipality with a free-rider incentive cannot increase local public debt to excess by using the regulation. Therefore, the average free-rider effect per capita is approximately 7 % of the average local public debt per capita for the end of the pre-treatment period. This result is considerably lower than the effects of the Swedish cases. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","amalgamation, free-rider behavior, and regulation",2016,International Tax and Public Finance,"Nakazawa, K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Using a comprehensive database on successful and rejected applications for the European Union's Structural and Cohesion Funds between 2004 and 2012 in Hungary, we study which grant types are susceptible to political favoritism and how this is achieved. With fixed-effects and matching estimators we study whether applicants from municipalities with a mayor endorsed by the governing coalition won a higher grant value than applicants where the mayor was affiliated with the opposition. We find limited evidence for such a difference for total grant value, but in cases when the applicant is a public entity or the purpose of the project is construction and, therefore, visible to voters and thus may bring about electoral benefits, we do find effects of 16–21%. The decomposition of the effect suggests that favoritism plays a role both in the application and the decision making process as applicants from aligned townships apply in larger numbers and have higher acceptance rates. When analyzing the effect of grants on votes, we show that voters indeed reward construction and public projects but not the other grant types. © 2016",political incentives and state subsidy allocation: evidence from hungarian municipalities,2016,European Economic Review,"Muraközy, B., Telegdy, Á.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",131
"This paper revisits the claim that supermajority rules and bicameral legislative structures restrain excessive government spending and taxation. Our analysis suggests that the extension effect of a supermajority rule—that requires logrolling across additional members—increases with the ratio of seats in the House relative to seats in the Senate. Using a panel of US states, 1970–2008, we find that the ratio of House-to-Senate seats has a robust, positive impact on the tendency of a supermajority rule to inflate the budget. Our finding implies that a supermajority rule can have a perverse effect on budget outcomes in bicameral legislatures owing to two factors: the geographic overlap between chambers and the low price elasticity of demand for public goods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",supermajority rule and bicameral bargaining,2016,Public Choice,"Lee, D.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,132

"New indices of fiscal rule strength are constructed and, using a dynamic panel econometric model for 27 EU countries over the period 1990–2012, we assess whether national fiscal rules alone help to promote sustainable public finances in the EU or whether they must be supported by good governance in order to be effective. We find that fiscal rules are effective in reducing structural primary deficits at all levels of government efficiency. However, the effect is smaller as government efficiency increases, indicating that fiscal rules and government efficiency are institutional substitutes in terms of promoting fiscal sustainability. We also find that balanced budget rules are the most effective form of fiscal rules. Multiple fiscal rules are found to enhance fiscal solvency. Other institutional features that enhance the effectiveness of fiscal rules are transparency of policies and commitment to implementation of fiscal programs. Supranational rules, however, do not affect the effectiveness of national fiscal rules in reducing the deficit bias.

"An important reform of the Italian Constitution, has been approved by Parliament in April 2016 and will be submitted to a referendum in Autumn 2016. This paper examines its consequences on the procedures for approval of the budget and of expenditure bills and on intergovernmental financial relations. The abandonment of a perfect bicameral system will give to the lower house a clear prevalence in the approval of laws including the budget. This will bring Italy more in line with the international experience. The Senate however will maintain equal legislative power in a series of matters. The capacity of playing its role effectively will depend on the implementation of the reform. In particular the actual mode of selection of senators by regional councils needs to be clarified. The reform also reshapes the relations between State and Regions, in favor of the central State. Particularly important is the shifting of co-ordination of public finance and the taxation system from the matters attributed to concurrent legislation to those for which the State has exclusive legislative powers. The most serious limit of this part of the reform, however, is the virtual exclusion of the five Regions that have special forms of autonomy. © Società Editrice Il Mulino.",the italian constitutional reform: consequences for the public finance system [la riforma costituzionale: i riflessi sull'ordinamento della finanza pubblica],2016,Politica Economica,"Pisauro, G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Using a within-member research design, we find that seats on key committees produce little additional spending.

"A central question in political economy is whether decision-making in representative democracies is biased towards local public investments or other types of policies which have locally concentrated benefits. The model by Weingast et al. (1981) predicts that a legislature with members from different areas will spend more in total on local public goods when the geographic constituency of each member is small. I test this prediction using panel data on the 18 Norwegian regional councils, exploiting that the geographic allocation of regional council seats varies considerably over time. Consistent with the theory, I find robust evidence that investments in regional public roads are lower when many council members come from the more populated areas in the region. This gives a more direct test of the prediction by Weingast et al. (1981) than existing empirical evidence, which concerns the relationship between public spending and legislature size.

"This paper explores a striking form of tax policy interdependence that can be observed in the German federation. Though municipalities enjoy discretion in setting the local business tax rate, large fractions of municipalities – in some states even the majority – set identical tax rates. Our analysis shows that this tax-rate “bunching” is not the result of federal or state-level institutions. Possible explanations rest on partial coordination and yardstick competition. The role of the former is exemplified by the finding that small jurisdictions and jurisdictions sharing the same county are more likely to engage in “bunching”. Yardstick competition seems also relevant since jurisdictions for which strategic tax-setting should be associated with larger gains and lower cost are in fact more likely to set identical tax rates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",yardstick competition and partial coordination: exploring the empirical distribution of local business tax rates,2016,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,"Buettner, T., von Schwerin, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper examines whether revenue decentralization and direct external financial supervision affect the incidence and strength of political budget cycles, using a panel of Israeli municipalities during the period 1999-2009. We find that high dependence on central government transfers - as reflected in a low share of locally raised revenues in the municipality's budget - exacerbates political budget cycles, while tight monitoring - exercised through central government appointment of external accountants to debt accumulating municipalities - eliminates them. We also find that this pattern is predominantly accounted for by development expenditures. These results suggest that political budget cycles can result from fiscal institutions that create soft budget constraints: that is, where incumbents and rational voters can expect that the costs of pre-election expansions will be partly covered later by the central government. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","revenue decentralization, central oversight and the political budget cycle: evidence from israel",2016,European Journal of Political Economy,"Baskaran, T., Brender, A., Blesse, S., Reingewertz, Y.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",142
"Recent proceedings involving large municipalities such as Detroit, Stockton, and Vallejo illustrate both the utility and limitations of using the Bankruptcy Code to adjust municipal debt. In this Article, we contend that, to resolve fully the distress of a substantial city, municipal bankruptcy needs to provide more than simple debt reduction. Debt adjustment alone does nothing to remedy the fragmented decision making and incentives for expanding municipal budgets that are ingrained in municipal governance structures and that often underlie municipal distress. Unless bankruptcy also addresses governance dysfunction, the city faces a return to financial distress. Indeed, this Article demonstrates that governance restructuring has long been an essential element of corporate bankruptcy and that, given the monopoly position of local governments as providers of local public goods, it is even more important in the municipal bankruptcy context. Some might argue that reducing a city’s debt is the best that bankruptcy courts can offer, due to concerns that a more comprehensive approach would, among other things, interfere with state sovereignty and exceed the statutory authority that the Bankruptcy Code grants to courts. In our view, these concerns do not withstand scrutiny. Based on a careful analysis of the origins of the current municipal bankruptcy provisions, as well as an assessment of recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, we argue that governance reform is permitted even under existing law, and point out that minor adjustments to municipal bankruptcy law would make this conclusion even clearer. To be sure, the states themselves, rather than a bankruptcy court, ideally should be the ones to effect municipal governance reform. But political factors and the imperatives of the immediate fiscal crisis make state intervention unlikely, thus underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach to municipal bankruptcy. © 2016, Yale Law Journal.

"We ask whether the birthplaces of Italian members of Parliament are favoured in the allocation of central government transfers. Using a panel of municipalities for the years between 1994 and 2006, we find that municipal governments of legislators' birth towns receive larger transfers per capita. Exploiting variation in birthplaces induced by parliamentary turnover for estimation, we find that this effect is driven by legislators who were born in a town outside their district of election. As a result, we argue that our findings cannot be a consequence of re-election incentives, the usual motivation for pork-barrel policies in the literature. Rather, politicians may be pursuing other personal motives. In line with this hypothesis, we find that the birth town bias essentially disappears when legislative elections are near.

"We analyze whether voters value local political representation by exploiting municipal mergers, which increase the number of candidates available to voters and intensify political competition. In the Finnish open-list proportional representation system, voters rank the candidates within parties, and thus, concentrating votes to local candidates increases the extent of local representation. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the vote distributions become more concentrated in municipalities less likely to gain local representation after the mergers. Moreover, the effect is much larger in municipalities where the benefits of local representation to voters are large. The latter result disentangles voters' responses from the responses of other political actors. The results are important also for designing local government mergers, which are an important policy tool in many countries. They highlight that concerns over deteriorating local democracy due to mergers have merit, because voters have preferences for local representation. At the same time, the vote concentration patterns we find alleviate these concerns. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",local representation and strategic voting: evidence from electoral boundary reforms,2016,European Journal of Political Economy,"Saarimaa, T., Tukiainen, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",147

"Purpose: Among the many perspectives to analyze war, such as rational actor, organizational process, governmental politics and ethics, the perspective that actually incorporates the costs and benefits into a systematic theoretical structure has hardly been analyzed. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the costs and benefits perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Three kinds of value are distinguished, i.e. human, economic and influence. Different actors (politicians, populations, stakeholders, etc). assign different weights to the three kinds of value. Six gradually more complicated models are developed. The first subtracts losses from gains for the three kinds of value. Thereafter, the paper accounts for multiple periods, time discounting, attitude towards risk, multiple stakeholders, subcategories for the three kinds of value, sequential decision-making and game theory. Findings: The rich theoretical structure enables assessing costs and benefits more systematically and illuminatingly. The cost benefit analysis is illustrated with the 2003-2011 Iraq War. The paper estimates gained and lost value of human lives, economic value and influence value, and show how different weights impact the decision of whether to initiate war differently.

"A widespread perception exists among political commentators, campaign operatives and presidential candidates that vice presidential (VP) running mates can deliver their home state’s electoral votes in a presidential election. In recent elections, presidential campaigns have even changed their strategy in response to the perceived VP home state advantage. But is the advantage real? And could it decide a presidential election? In the most comprehensive analysis to date, Devine and Kopko demonstrate that the VP home state advantage is actually highly conditional and rarely decisive in the Electoral College. However, it could change the outcome of a presidential election under narrow but plausible conditions. Sophisticated in its methodology and rich in historical as well as contemporary insight, The VP Advantage is essential and accessible reading for anyone interested in understanding how running mates influence presidential elections. © Christopher J.

"In Confederate Political Economy, Michael Bonner suggests that the Confederate nation was an expedient corporatist state -- a society that required all sectors of the economy to work for the national interest, as defined by a partnership of industrial leaders and a dominant government. As Bonner shows, the characteristics of the Confederate States' political economy included modern organizational methods that mirrored the economic landscape of other late nineteenth-century and early-twentieth-century corporatist governments. Southern leaders, Bonner argues, were slave-owning agricultural capitalists who sought a counterrevolution against northern liberal capitalism. During secession and as the war progressed, they built and reinforced Confederate nationalism through specific centralized government policies. Bolstered by the Confederate constitution, these policies evolved into a political culture that allowed for immense executive powers, facilitated an anti-party ideology, and subordinated individual rights. In addition, the South's lack of industrial capacity forced the Confederacy to pursue a curious manufacturing policy that used both private companies and national ownership to produce munitions. This symbiotic relationship was just one component of the Confederacy's expedient corporatist state: other wartime policies like conscription, the domestic passport system, and management of southern railroads also exhibited unmistakable corporatist characteristics. Bonner's probing research and new comparative analysis expand our understanding of the complex organization and relationships in Confederate political and economic culture during the Civil War. © 2016 by Louisiana State University Press.

The Politics of Technological Progress answers these vital questions by highlighting the importance of technological progress for sustained economic development. The author also explains why some countries exhibit faster technological progress than others. Armed with a wealth of cross-national empirical evidence, Professor Simmons stresses the importance of properly constructed political parties for establishing an environment conducive to technological progress. ‘Well-institutionalized’ ruling parties are essential for technological progress, he argues, because only in such parties are time horizons long enough for governments to accept the deferred returns that are an inherent feature of government efforts to encourage innovation and technology adoption in the economy. © 2016.","the politics of technological progress: parties, time horizons, and long-term economic development",2016,"The Politics of Technological Progress: Parties, Time Horizons and Long-term Economic Development","Simmons, J.W.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"International trade often inspires intense conflict between workers and their employers. In this book, Adam Dean studies the conditions under which labor and capital collaborate in support of the same trade policies. Dean argues that capital-labor agreement on trade policy depends on the presence of “profit-sharing institutions.” He tests this theory through case studies from the United States, Britain, and Argentina in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries; they offer a revisionist history placing class conflict at the center of the political economy of trade. Analysis of data from more than one hundred countries from 1986 to 2002 demonstrates that the field’s conventional wisdom systematically exaggerates the benefits that workers receive from trade policy reforms. From Conflict to Coalition boldly explains why labor is neither an automatic beneficiary nor an automatic ally of capital when it comes to trade policy and distributional conflict. © Adam Dean 2016.",from conflict to coalition: profit-sharing institutions and the political economy of trade,2016,From Conflict to Coalition: Profit-Sharing Institutions and the Political Economy of Trade,"Dean, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Numerous scholars have noticed that certain political institutions, including federalism, majoritarian electoral systems, and presidentialism, are linked to lower levels of income redistribution. This book offers a political geography explanation for those observed patterns. Each of these institutions is strongly shaped by geography and provides incentives for politicians to target their appeals and government resources to localities. Territorialized institutions also shape citizens’ preferences in ways that can undermine the national coalition in favor of redistribution. Moreover, territorial institutions increase the number of veto points in which anti-redistributive actors can constrain reform efforts. These theoretical connections between the politics of place and redistributive outcomes are explored in theory, empirical analysis, and case studies of the USA, Germany, and Argentina. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",the politics of place and the limits of redistribution,2016,The Politics of Place and the Limits of Redistribution,"Rogers, M.Z.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Poverty relief programs are shaped by politics. The particular design which social programs take is to a large extent determined by the existing institutional constraints and politicians’ imperative to win elections. The Political Logic of Poverty Relief places elections and institutional design at the core of poverty alleviation. The authors develop a theory with applications to Mexico about how elections shape social programs aimed at aiding the poor. Would political parties possess incentives to target the poor with transfers aimed at poverty alleviation or would they instead give these to their supporters? Would politicians rely on the distribution of particularistic benefits rather than public goods? The authors assess the welfare effects of social programs in Mexico and whether voters reward politicians for targeted poverty alleviation programs.

"For most of political science's history, discussions about professional ethics had nothing to do with human subjects. Professional ethics involved integrity in the classroom, fair tenure and promotion rule, and the careful avoidance of plagiarism. As most research was observational, there was little need for attention to how scholarly activities might directly affect the subjects of our work. Times have changed. The dramatic growth in the use of experiments in social science, especially overseas, is generating unexpected ethical controversies. The purpose of this volume is to identify, debate, and propose practical solutions to the most critical of these new ethical issues. A leading team of internationally distinguished political science scholars presents the first examination of the practical and ethical challenges of research with human subjects in social science and policy studies. Part 1 examines contextual challenges provided by experiments conducted overseas - questions of culture, religion, security, and poverty. Part 2 examines questions of legal constraints on research, focusing on questions of foreign review of international experiments. Part 3 tackles the critical issues in field experiments, including deception and consent, impact on elections and careers, the boundaries of the public officials' exemption, and the use of partner organizations to avoid Institutional Review Body (IRB) review. Part 4 considers strategies for the future, including training and education, IRB reform, institutional changes, and norm development. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

"We develop a model of political accountability with sequential policymaking. When a bureaucrat's actions are transparent, his overseer faces a political time inconsistency problem-she is tempted to revise her retention rule in the middle of the policymaking process. As a result, the bureaucrat's equilibrium behavior overemphasizes later tasks. If the overseer knows the technology by which policies translate into outcomes, then she can eliminate these distortions using task-specific budget caps. However, if the overseer is uncertain about this technology, such budget caps introduce ex post inefficiency. When uncertainty is sufficiently large and consequential, the overseer prefers an institutional environment with a fungible budget and no transparency. Such an environment allows the overseer to exploit the bureaucrat's expertise, though at the cost of weaker overall incentives. © 2015.",political accountability and sequential policymaking,2015,Journal of Public Economics,"Bueno de Mesquita, E., Landa, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"How much can a constituency influence the power of its representative in the legislature? This article develops a theoretical model of the constituency basis of legislator influence. The key players in the model are interest groups that may receive targeted transfers from the legislature. The model predicts that the amount of transfers that such groups receive is increasing in their ability to help a party win a legislative seat in the next election. This claim is tested using the changes in Japanese central-to-municipality transfers after a representative passes away while in office. The study finds that electorally 'strong' constituency groups do not lose transfers when they lose their representatives. However when 'weak' constituency groups lose their representatives, the transfers decrease.

"Conflicts of interest within hierarchic government organizations regarding the importance of fiscal discipline create the need for institutions that curb the bargaining power of units in charge of implementing policy and align their incentives to the interests of the whole organization. We examine this general public sector problem by collecting unique data on budget institutions and conflicts of interest within the Swedish municipalities. Our estimations suggest that institutions pertaining to both the planning stage and the implementation stage of the budget process are important for fiscal performance. The fiscal surplus is higher in municipalities that have centralized their budget process to some degree, and where local committees are allowed to carry over surpluses or forced to carry over deficits between fiscal years. The associations however differ between municipalities with different degrees of conflicts of interests, calling for further research to understand the incentives given by the result carry-over rules. We further find that the fiscal surplus is higher in municipalities where local managers face a relatively high risk of dismissal as a consequence of budget deficits. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",institutions improving fiscal performance: evidence from swedish municipalities,2015,International Tax and Public Finance,"Dietrichson, J., Ellegård, L.M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",161

"Predicting available tax revenue accurately is a key step of fiscal policy. It has recently been shown that revenue projection errors have a direct impact on fiscal deficits. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the ideology of the finance minister and tax revenue projection errors, and assess how the stringency of fiscal rules alters this relationship. We use a panel dataset of 26 Swiss cantons over the period 1980-2007 as well as a new dataset of 99 finance ministers at the cantonal level. Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that the allocation of the departments - including the department of finance - to the elected politicians is a random process from the point of view of the voters. We identify a rather counter-intuitive positive effect of the ideology of the finance minister on tax revenue projection errors in the sense that a more left-wing finance minister produces relatively more conservative forecasts. We also find that fiscal rules reduce the effect of ideology on tax revenue projection errors. These results suggest that left-wing finance ministers need to curb deficits relatively more in order to signal the same level of competence to the voters than right-wing finance ministers. They also suggest that fiscal rules render the signal less informative to the voters and thereby reduce the incentive for left-wing finance ministers to be more conservative in their projections. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",incentive effects of fiscal rules on the finance minister's behavior: evidence from revenue projections in swiss cantons,2015,European Journal of Political Economy,"Chatagny, F.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Ethno-regional voting cleavages have featured in a number of sub-Saharan African states during the third wave of democratization. While these voting patterns are well studied, there have been few attempts to understand if pan-ethno-regional coalition building based on targeted economic policies can be employed to secure national electoral coalitions. We examine the 2009 Malawian parliamentary elections where a newly-formed national party used its incumbent position to promote an economic policy based on food security in order to overcome traditional ethno-regional voting patterns. After presenting a formal model of an optimal allocation of an economic resource to induce vote-switching, we use district-level data in a system of equations approach finding that this strategic allocation did indeed contribute to the nation-wide electoral victory. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",fertilizer and votes: does strategic economic policy explain the 2009 malawi election?,2015,Electoral Studies,"Brazys, S., Heaney, P., Walsh, P.P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper investigates the impact of a supermajority rule on the law of 1/n, which posits that a larger number of districts increases the size of government.

I find that partitioned municipalities provide 58% more primary schools and 37% more teachers (per capita). Driven mainly by convergent preferences for ethnically oriented schools, however, this arrangement delivers distributional consequences: in partitioned municipalities, ethnic majority children are more likely to complete primary schooling, while for ethnic minority children it is the opposite. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","together or separate? post-conflict partition, ethnic homogenization, and the provision of public schooling",2015,Journal of Public Economics,"Swee, E.L.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",166
"The literature on distributive politics suggests that politicians have incentives to engage in targeted spending especially in decentralized political systems with weak parties and candidate-centered elections. We argue that in centralized political systems with party-centered elections parties use intergovernmental transfers to advance their electoral fortune via performance spillovers across different levels of government. On the basis of a new data set on partisan composition of local councils in England and grants allocated by the central government during 1992-2012, and using a differencein- difference approach, we provide evidence that governments allocate up to 17% more money to local councils controlled by their ""own"" party. Furthermore, we show that the effect is strongest closer to local election years, in local councils where institutions facilitate credit claiming, and in swing councils. © 2015 Southern Political Science Association.",english bacon: copartisan bias in intergovernmental grant allocation in england,2015,Journal of Politics,"Fouirnaies, A., Mutlu-Eren, H.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Central government bailouts of local governments are commonly viewed as a recipe for local fiscal indiscipline, as local governments learn that the center will come to the rescue in times of trouble. However, little is known about the consequences of bailouts granted conditional on local governments first making efforts to improve the situation. We examine a case in which the Swedish central government provided conditional grants to 36 financially troubled municipalities. We use the synthetic control method to identify suitable comparison units for each of the 36 municipalities. To compare the development of costs and the fiscal surplus of admitted municipalities to that of their most similar counterparts during the decade after the program, we then estimate fixed effects regressions on the resulting sample.

"Italian health care expenditure (HCE) has been basically explained with two main groups of theories. (1) Those explaining the peculiarity of the HCE growth as depending on demand and supply factors, such as aging population, number of practising physicians per capita, mix of public and private hospitals, number of hospital beds,… (2) Those explaining the growth of total public expenditure as a common feature among industrialized countries, with a huge empirical literature emphasising the role of GDP and/or other structural/institutional variables as the main determinants of HCE across countries. In order to reassess previous findings, we exploit recent results on panel cointegration analysis and test the regional Italian data on HCE and GDP, also taking into account cross-section correlation. The results show that HCE and GDP are cointegrated. The long- and short-term dynamics of HCE are estimated. Our results, providing an empirical support for the existence of Wagner’s law, have important policy implications in terms of fiscal sustainability: as income rises, people will choose relatively more HCE.

"The comparative study of debt and fiscal consolidation has acquired a new focus in the wake of the global financial crisis. This paper re-evaluates the literature on fiscal consolidation that flourished during the 1980s and 1990s. The conventional approach to explanation is based on segmenting episodes of fiscal change into discrete observations. We argue that this misses the dynamic features of government strategy, especially in the choices made between expenditure-based and revenue-based fiscal consolidation strategies. We propose a focus on pathways rather than episodes of adjustment, to capture what Pierson terms 'politics in time'. A case-study approach facilitates analysis of complex causality that includes the structures of interest intermediation, the role of ideas in shaping the set of feasible policy choices, and the situation of national economies in the international political economy. We support our argument with qualitative data based on two case studies, Ireland and Greece, and with additional paired comparisons of Ireland with Britain, and Greece with Spain.

"Objective: I examine the relationship between legislature size and several components of government spending using a methodology that allows me to estimate how legislature size influences the fiscal response to shocks that are common to all states. Method: I use nonlinear least squares on a panel of 48 of the 50 American states over the period 1978-2008. Results: I find little evidence that states with larger than average lower or upper chambers experience a larger change in spending per capita in the presence of a shock. I do find a positive relationship between lower chamber size and the first difference of welfare spending per capita, but this increase is partially offset by a negative relationship between upper chamber size and welfare spending. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the interest groups theory of government, which states that larger legislatures can be associated with lobbying and bargaining costs that may have offsetting effects. © 2015 Southwestern Social Science Association.","government spending, shocks, and the role of legislature size: evidence from the american states",2015,Social Science Quarterly,"Hankins, W.B.",Scopus,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,174
"Research on the fiscal consequences of multilevel governance has largely focused on the interaction between federal and state governments. Yet, the federal system in the United States is considerably more complex and includes the vertical layering of governments at the local level. This research examines the relationship between the overlapping system of local governments and fiscal discipline in the public sector. It focuses on both the static and dynamic aspects of fiscal performance, specifically own-source revenues and debt. Using different measures of the vertical structure of the local governance system, and controlling for the effects of other factors including measures of horizontal competition, the empirical analysis finds that the overlaying of local governments creates a bias for a bigger public sector, but much of the bias can be traced to a specific type of government. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",the fiscal performance of overlapping local governments,2015,Public Finance Review,"Jimenez, B.S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",175

"This article analyses the link between fiscal balance and political fragmentation. While a large body of literature states that political fragmentation leads to fiscal deficits, others suggest that political fragmentation is associated with political competition, which tends to improve fiscal balance. These hypotheses are tested using budgetary and political data of municipalities in Israel for the years 1998–2006. The results suggest that both hypotheses may be correct, depending on voting behaviour. In Arab municipalities, where residents vote according to clan affiliation, low levels of political fragmentation are associated with large debts. On the contrary, in Jewish municipalities, low levels of political fragmentation are associated with small debts, since in these cases, coalition formation requires less spending and is easier to sustain. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",political fragmentation and fiscal status: evidence from municipalities in israel,2015,Local Government Studies,"Reingewertz, Y.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",178
"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency cost of transfers. To this end, we develop a model of individual demand decisions about the provision of a regional public good that encompasses a continuum of tax–transfer scenarios to finance regional public expenditure. We assume that individuals have identical quasi-linear preferences defined over private consumption and the regional public good, that endowment income varies between individuals and regions, and that regions have different predetermined sizes. In an economy-wide resource constrained framework we show that, despite its simplicity, this model is capable of discriminating the efficiency properties of the different scenarios considered, and that the substitution of matching transfers for own-regional taxes always raises the provision of the regional public good, despite the resource-constrained nature of the exercise. The model allows very easily the analysis of equalising transfers, which we show to be distorting only when a matching element is present. We also find that, when transfers have a matching element, ‘fiscal illusion’ increases the elasticity of public good provision with respect to transfers, and suggest a potentially refutable hypothesis to identify the existence of this phenomenon. © 2015 Pion and its Licensors.","intergovernmental fiscal relations: the efficiency effect of taxes, transfers, and fiscal illusion",2015,Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy,"López-Laborda, J., Zabalza, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Distributive politics plays an integral role in theories of legislative politics because it represents a fundamental aspect of legislators' electoral connection to constituents.

"This study is concerned with the broad question of why more pluralism reduces expenditure in local governments. According to the literature, proportional representation (PR) systems are associated with greater expenditure, but I offer empirical evidence showing that the case of Mexican local governments challenges this notion. An amendment to the Federal Constitution in 1983 allowed Mexican states to change the electoral rule for assigning incumbents to local councils in municipalities. Variations in the way state legislatures interpreted the Constitution produced two types of municipal councils, with majority representation or PR. These are examined in detail and tested using a difference-in-difference analysis to explore the decentralization reform and its wider ramifications. I conclude that more pluralism in conjunction with the current design of local councils increases the chances of gridlock. This is evident in budgetary decisions and explains why changes to electoral rules do not suffice to improve local government performance. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization.",why does more pluralism reduce expenditure? the case of how mexico's old institutions affect waves of democratic reform,2015,Politics and Policy,"Meza, O.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",181
"We investigate the rise of federal military pensions in the antebellum US Congress to examine whether key aspects of the contemporary electoral connection were present in earlier historical eras. Overall, the political responses of members of Congress to pressures for military service pensions reveal that the quest for credit-claiming opportunities significantly shaped the adoption and evolution of this type of distributive legislation. Analyzing key legislative activity from 1818 to 1832, we find that members’ electoral interests gave rise to a particularistic and often inefficient system of benefits. Specifically, what began as a relatively simple program to provide for disabled Revolutionary War veterans grew into a broader entitlement-style program based on military service that legislators carefully cultivated in order to maximize their prospects for subsequent political advantage. Our analysis thus reveals that crucial features of the electoral connection were indeed present in the antebellum-era Congress, a finding that broadens our collective understanding of the early foundations of American political development. © The Author(s) 2015.","distributive politics, the electoral connection, and the antebellum us congress: the case of military service pensions",2015,Journal of Theoretical Politics,"Finocchiaro, C.J., Jenkins, J.A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",182
"Although there is a burgeoning empirical literature on the rapid growth of health expenditures, there has been little systematic examination of the influence of central government financing behavior. In addition, studies examining the effect of political variables are relatively few and, as they seem to suffer from the omitted variable bias problem, generate improper inferences on health financing dynamics. Moving from this literature, and drawing on recent developments in the coalition governance, as well as researching on fiscal decentralization, in this paper we aim to gain insight into the Italian health care financing scenario taking into account the behaviors of government intervention in the sector. Specifically, we analyze regional political fragmentation and competition for effective political power between majority and opposition coalitions and we test if the fragmentation of both coalitions is the key variables that determine their effective political power. We test our hypothesis in the Italian framework with a new dataset. Data include financial, demographic and political variables.

"In decentralised European Monetary Union members such as Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany and Spain, the Stability and Growth Pact can only be implemented if there is close fiscal coordination among government tiers. Thus, limits on subcentral governments' debt are essential in this coordination. This paper analyses which political and socio-economic factors influence compliance with debt limits. We use a database with information on Spanish municipalities with at least 1,000 inhabitants for 2001-08. Our results indicate that the non-financial surplus limit is the requirement that is most commonly breached, followed by the net operating balance requisite. Population has a positive and significant impact on failure to comply with debt limits. In addition, we show a positive relationship between income level and global limit compliance.

"Abstract: It is becoming difficult to maintain consensus in a period of economic austerity, and this possibly challenges the ability of democratic institutions to take decisions on tough economic questions. In order to find out how political consensus influences fiscal outcomes, this article sets out to analyse the association between political consensus and public expenditure growth. The results show that political consensus is positively associated with both budgeted and actual expenditure growth, but also negatively associated with budget overruns. This indicates that political consensus comes at a cost, while at the same time politicians may be better at sticking to budgets if political consensus exists. The analysis is based on a pooled regression analysis of the local governments in Denmark in the years 2008 and 2009 using a data set combining survey data with administrative data on the local governments. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",political consensus and fiscal outcomes,2015,Local Government Studies,"Houlberg, K., Pedersen, L.H.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",185
"The Great Recession resulted in fiscal crises for governments across the Western world. Significant cuts in government programs were initiated as many governments scrambled to reduce their growing budget deficits. This article explores how European governments reacted during the recent crisis. In particular, the authors focus on the interlinkages between shifts toward more centralized decision making. The article uses a survey of thousands of public sector executives in 17 European countries. The authors find evidence of a centralization cascade, such that centralizing one element of the decision-making process leads to greater centralization throughout the system. Results also show that having a high number of organizational goals and facing clear sanctions for failing to achieve goals lead to greater centralization, but greater organizational commitment reduces the need to centralize. © 2015 by The American Society for Public Administration.",the impact of fiscal crisis on decision-making processes in european governments: dynamics of a centralization cascade,2015,Public Administration Review,"Raudla, R., Douglas, J.W., Randma-Liiv, T., Savi, R.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",186
"The main objective of this manuscript is to test two competing hypotheses from the regionalism/localism literature regarding local government size. The Leviathan hypothesis argues that fragmentation induces lower spending through more decentralised government structures which are smaller relative to the size of the local economy. This argument is in sharp opposition with the supporters of regionalism who argue that territorial centralisation can produce economies of scale and significant cost savings, reduce overlaps and promote a more efficient local government. These competing hypotheses derived from the literature are tested using data collected from all 278 local governments of continental Portugal. We measure local government size as both per capita total expenditures and per capita grant transfers to sub-city governments and territorial fragmentation as the number of sub-city governments per 1,000 individuals. Our findings indicate that higher levels of sub-city fragmentation lead to increased municipal government spending and transfers to sub-city governments, thus suggesting that the amalgamation of sub-city governments required by the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2011 by the Portuguese government, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank and mandated by national legislation has the potential to induce cost savings and to improve financial sustainability. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",the economic and political impacts of top-down territorial reforms: the case of sub-city governments,2015,Local Government Studies,"Tavares, A.F., Rodrigues, M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",187
"Oliver Pamp analyzes the likelihood and extent of pension reforms from a political-economy perspective. It is shown that voters’ preferences for or against reforms are influenced by a societies’ demographic development, the generosity of its existing public pension scheme and its electoral system. The author extensively reviews existing formal models of pension systems, discusses their merits and limitations, and develops a three-period overlapping generations model. The model’s insights regarding individual reform preferences are then put into the context of different electoral systems, thus emphasizing the important role of electoral institutions in the aggregation of societal preferences. Finally, using cross-national survey data, logit and ordered-logit analyses tentatively confirm some of the model’s main implications. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2015.",political preferences and the aging of populations: political-economy explanations of pension reform,2015,Political Preferences and the Aging of Populations: Political-Economy Explanations of Pension Reform,"Pamp, O.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Why do some developing countries have more efficient health systems and better health outcomes? Contrary to existing theory that posits the superiority of proportional representation (PR) rules on public-goods provision, this book argues that electoral rules function differently given the underlying ethnic structure. In countries with low ethnic salience, PR has the same positive effect as in past theories. In countries with high ethnic salience, the geographic distribution of ethnic groups further matters: Where they are intermixed, PR rules are worse for health outcomes; where they are isolated, neither rule is superior. The theory is supported through a combination of careful analysis of electoral reform in individual country cases with numerous well-designed cross-country comparisons. The case studies include Thailand, Mauritius, Malaysia, Botswana, Burma and Indonesia. The theory has broad implications for electoral rule design and suggests a middle ground in the debate between the Consociational and Centripetal schools of thought. © Joel Sawat Selway 2015.",coalitions of the well-being: how electoral rules and ethnic politics shape health policy in developing countries,2015,Coalitions of the Wellbeing: How Electoral Rules and Ethnic Politics Shape Health Policy in Developing Countries,"Selway, J.S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This book explores one of the most significant trends in the evolution of global tax systems by asking how, within less than half a century, the value-added tax (VAT) has risen from relative obscurity to become one of the world’s most dominant revenue instruments. Despite its significance, very little is known about why so many countries have adopted the VAT and, in particular, why different countries adopt the types of VAT that they do. The popular mythology provides that the merits of the VAT have underpinned its global spread; however, this book contends that much scholarship on the VAT confuses the question of why the VAT has risen to dominance with the issue of what makes a good VAT. This book combines policy and legal analysis to propose a new way of understanding the rise of this important revenue instrument so as to better reflect the realities of the VATs that are actually implemented. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

"As a growing research program has illustrated, parliaments are not merely ‘rubber stamps’ for
governmental proposals. Analyzing the voting stage on government legislation can thus be extremely
informative in parliamentary settings: are government bills backed just by the representatives forming
the legislative majority, or do they (also) receive the votes of members of the opposition?
The present paper examines the degree of support that governmental legislation enjoys at the final vote
in Italy. In this regard, the Italian case seems particularly interesting: despite the harsh confrontation
among parties in the public debate, legislation (including government bills) has usually been approved
by very large parliamentary majorities, and the consensuality characterizing Italian lawmaking seems to
have survived even the end of the pivotal First Republic and the shift to the alternational and (would-be)
majoritarian Second Republic.
Up to now, the literature has primarily focused on the aggregate figures of the degree of support gained
by Italian laws at the final voting stage in the parliament, while the internal differences between more
and less consensual processes remain a rather understudied topic. However, not all the bills introduced
by the Italian governments are approved in a consensual manner. Their approval can be more universal
in some cases, and more strictly majoritarian in other cases.
This work investigates such a variance. In particular, a set of explanatory hypotheses are empirically
evaluated against data on the legislative production of Italian governments over a relatively long period
of time (1988-2006). The hypotheses I test include the policy divisions between majority and opposition,
the complexity of the bargaining environment, distributive logics and legislative impatience.
Remarkably, I also evaluate the impact of two factors that are specifically related to the processes
through which bills are approved: the length of the legislative process and the extent to which bills are
modified in parliament before approval. Taking into account these two important process-related aspects
may contribute to a more dynamic study of what happens at the final voting stage in the parliament.

"Constituents often fail to hold their representatives accountable for federal spending decisions-even though those very choices have a pervasive influence on American life. Why does this happen? Breaking new ground in the study of representation, The Impression of Influence demonstrates how legislators skillfully inform constituents with strategic communication and how this facilitates or undermines accountability. Using a massive collection of Congressional texts and innovative experiments and methods, the book shows how legislators create an impression of influence through credit claiming messages. Anticipating constituents' reactions, legislators claim credit for programs that elicit a positive response, making constituents believe their legislator is effectively representing their district. This spurs legislators to create and defend projects popular with their constituents. Yet legislators claim credit for much more-they announce projects long before they begin, deceptively imply they deserve credit for expenditures they had little role in securing, and boast about minuscule projects. Unfortunately, legislators get away with seeking credit broadly because constituents evaluate the actions that are reported, rather than the size of the expenditures. The Impression of Influence raises critical questions about how citizens hold their political representatives accountable and when deception is allowable in a democracy. © 2015 by Princeton University Press.

"In a recent study, Dash and Raja (2013) have shown that the size and composition of public expenditure of Indian states are systematically linked with political determinants such as the extent of government fragmentation, strength of opposition, electoral years, and ideology. This study extends the questions to whether there are similar links to revenue collections by the governments that rule the different states in India. Using the same time period of the previous study, four revenue measures related to tax collection and internal debt are considered and four different sets of hypotheses are developed by linking the political determinants with each of the revenue measures.

"In this article, we examine how the level of regulation affects the size distribution of businesses. To the extent that regulation functions as a fixed cost, it should lead to larger firm size. However, regulations may also lead to smaller establishments with firms outsourcing regulated activities or staying small to take advantage of state exemptions for small businesses from regulations. We empirically examine the relationship between the size distribution of establishments and the level of regulation using state- and industry-level panel data from 1992 to 2004. Our results suggest that regulation decreases the proportion of zero employee and 1-4 employee establishments. The proportion of establishments in the 5-9 employee range generally increases with the level of regulation. Thus, regulation appears to operate as a fixed cost causing establishments to be larger. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",regulatory costs on entrepreneurship and establishment employment size,2014,Small Business Economics,"Calcagno, P.T., Sobel, R.S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

It exploits within-country variation in adoption in a dynamic panel framework to estimate MTFs' impacts on aggregate as well as sectoral measures of fiscal performance.

"In OECD countries, we have observed a considerable increase in public debt over recent decades caused by large and lasting deficits. What is the reason for this development and why is it rather different by country? There are two approaches to explain this. Traditional economic theory explains why it makes sense to allow deficits of public budgets in certain situations, which might result in a limited amount of public debt. It also shows the conditions for the sustainability of public finances namely that public debt stays below certain limits and, in particular, does not - in the long run - increase faster than GDP. Following the recommendations of this approach, public budget surpluses should be run in economic upswings to compensate for deficits in recessions. By contrast, politico-economic approaches explain why democratic governments have incentives to allow deficits even in periods of economic upswings. In the long run, this can lead to ever-increasing public debt. To prevent this, institutional provisions are necessary. In this respect, Swiss debt brakes at the national and cantonal levels as well as the new German rules are of particular interest. © 2013 The Author.",on the political economy of public deficits and debt,2014,German Economic Review,"Kirchgässner, G.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",198

"The rationale for fiscal rules and institutions is explained by the existence of deficit and spending biases that arise due to political fragmentation within government or between governments that alternate in office. In common pool models fiscal outcomes are determined by the decision-making rule that is used to aggregate conflicting interests into a single budget and they can affect spending bias. Several institutional responses are possible for internalizing the overall costs of budgetary programs. These costs could be internalized by giving a strong mandate to the minister of finance, whose role is to consider the overall effects of policies. This paper analyzes a model in which the minister of finance internalizes the common pool budget's externality. First, we consider a model where all ministers play simultaneously, and MF acts as a spending minister. In order to capture the institutional framework, where MF takes in account the budget equilibrium, the authors have modeled the interaction in a sequential way. Under this assumption the minister of finance maximizes his utility function as a leader. In a sequential equilibrium, leader's expenditure choice is grater than in simultaneous result, while the deficit bias is lower due to agenda setting power over spending ministers. © Cristian Barra, Giovanna Bimonte, Pietro Spennati, 2014.",governance and efficiency of fiscal institutions,2014,Investment Management and Financial Innovations,"Barra, C., Bimonte, G., Spennati, P.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",201
"Politicians tend to push the amount of public debt beyond socially desirable levels in order to increase their reelection chances. We develop a model that provides a new explanation for this behavior: office holders undertake debt-financed public projects, but postpone the timing of part of the output to the next term. This makes it difficult to replace them. As a consequence, the office holders' reelection chances rise-as does public debt. As a potential remedy for this inefficiency, we allow candidates for public office to offer government debt-threshold contracts. Such a contract contains an upper limit for government debt and the sanction that an office holder violating this limit cannot stand for reelection. We show that such competitively offered contracts contain low debt levels that limit debt financing and improve the citizens' welfare. When negative macroeconomic events occur, government debt-threshold contracts may be violated, and the economy is stabilized.

"Distributive spending by a state is often thought to have an electoral connection, and the work on pork-barrel politics whereby spending is geographically targeted is extensive.

We find that the grants are targeted at the responsible minister's constituency.

"The paper examines the proposition from the law of 1 over n (Weingast et al. 1981) that project size tends to increase with common pool size.

"The literature on the tragedy of the commons is voluminous, and application to the fiscal commons is well established. In this article, we extend this application by examining the effects of the distribution of state and local governments' tax liability on budgetary outcomes. Different tax structures yield vastly different contributions from members of the polity, but all members may influence the draw from the fiscal commons through the political process. We find that when the tax burden is heavier for taxpayers at the top of the income distribution and lighter for taxpayers at the bottom of the income distribution, state and local government expenditures grow, and governments spend more on social welfare. However, we do not find a link between the distribution of tax liability and debt. © The Author(s) 2013.",grazing the state and local fiscal commons: do different tax prices lead to more or less grazing?,2014,Public Finance Review,"Lipford, J.W., Yandle, B.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",206
"According to an influential theoretical argument, presidential systems tend to present smaller governments relative to parliamentary countries because the separation between those who decide the size of the fiscal purse and those who allocate it creates incentives for lower public expenditures. In practice, however, presidential and parliamentary countries come in many forms. In particular, variation in procedural rules that assign budget prerogatives across the popular branches of government may affect the underlying incentives that differentiate these types of regimes in terms of fiscal outcomes. More specifically, we argue that more hierarchical rules that concentrate budgetary power in the executive relative to the legislature do not only reduce the extent of the common pool problem but also limit the degree of separation of powers, which may have a countervailing effect. Consequently, the effect of the form of government on public expenditures is conditional on specific procedural rules. We test this hypothesis on a broad cross-section of countries and find that presidentialism has a negative impact on government size only when executive discretion in the budget process is low (that is, in a context of separation of powers). However, the negative effect of presidentialism on expenditures vanishes when the executive's discretion over the budget process is higher. This result, in addition to highlighting that not all budget institutions have the same effect on incentives and outcomes, points out how important it is to go beyond broad characterizations of political institutions for explaining policy outcomes, and more generally, for moving forward the research agenda in constitutional political economy. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",the economic effects of constitutions: do budget institutions make forms of government more alike?,2014,Constitutional Political Economy,"Ardanaz, M., Scartascini, C.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A large literature on the 'flypaper effect' examines how federal grants to states at time period t affect state spending (or taxes) at time period t. We explore the fundamentally different question of how federal grants at time period t affect state tax policy in the future. Federal grants often result in states creating new programs and hiring new employees, and when the federal funding is discontinued, these new state programs must either be discontinued or financed through increases in state own source taxes. Government programs tend to be difficult to cut, as goes Milton Friedman's famous quote about nothing being as permanent as a temporary government program, suggesting that it is likely that temporary federal grants create permanent (future) ratchets in state taxes. Far from being purely an academic question, this argument is why South Carolina's Governor Mark Sanford attempted to turn down federal stimulus monies for his state. We examine both the impact of federal grants on future state budgets and how federal and state grants affect future local government budgets. Our findings confirm that grants indeed result in future state and local tax increases of roughly 40 cents for every dollar in grant money received in prior years. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",do intergovernmental grants create ratchets in state and local taxes?,2014,Public Choice,"Sobel, R.S., Crowley, G.R.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",209

"In this paper we reconstruct the macro regional government deficits of Italy and find that the aggregate deficit resulting from our estimates captures quite well the entire dynamics of the Italian national public deficit. This new data set shows that the ultimate cause of the accumulation of public debt of Italy lies in the extraordinary fiscal imbalance of the Southern regions. The new data allow us to test empirically a simple Common Pool model, augmented by a variable measuring the political influence of each macro region in the Government, to verify the existence of a geographically dispersed interests issue for the Italian case. Our measure of political influence turns out to significantly explain the regions' deficits also when controlling for population and income gaps. In addition, using a J-test approach, we find that including the predictions of the Common Pool-Pork Barrel regional model into a general model of the Italian national deficit turns out to greatly increase its explanatory power.

"Over the past three decades, a number of U.S. cities have shifted from at-large to district-based elections. Some observers argue that this institutional change encourages elected officials to focus on district priorities while ignoring-and perhaps even sacrificing-broader municipal needs. Must district elections bring parochialism and logrolling to city councils? Using seven years' worth of roll call data from the Los Angeles City Council, we examine the hypothesis that district elections result in vote-trading among its members. Overall, voting behavior on the council appears inconsistent with conventional logrolling accounts and instead points to a strategy of conditional deference on the part of elected officials.

"This study examines the role elections play in negotiations between states and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although loans made by the IMF often require countries to introduce painful austerity measures that provoke a backlash from angry citizens, some governments are able to negotiate more favorable terms than others. Original data on the substantive content of IMF loans show that governments leverage imminent elections to obtain more lenient loan terms. Conditions that require labor market reforms in exchange for IMF financing are relatively less stringent in loans negotiated within six months before a pending democratic election, all else equal. The further away elections are from loan negotiations, the more stringent the labor conditions included in countries' loan programs.

"Voter initiatives are important for policy making in many countries. While much research shows that the initiative process affects policy choices, almost no evidence explains how the initiative process affects policy. Initiatives might change policy directly through voters approving laws that override the legislature; or the initiative process may change policy indirectly by providing a threat that induces the legislature to change policy. This article develops an empirical strategy to measure the direct and indirect effects of the initiative based on the idea that direct effects can be inferred from states that actually pass initiatives while indirect effects can be inferred from states where the initiative is available but not used. Evidence from 50 states on nine separate issues suggests that both direct and indirect effects are important, but the direct effect is several times larger than the threat effect. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",disentangling the direct and indirect effects of the initiative process,2014,Public Choice,"Matsusaka, J.G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Over the past quarter-century, Chile has proven that the unthinkable is possible: A middle-income, natural resource-producing nation can have a fiscal policy that is both stable and sustainable. The core of this policy has been very simple: Act responsibly, design policy for the long run, and accumulate enough fiscal space so that fiscal policy can play a stabilizing role in the short run. The approach implies saving during periods of high copper prices and using those accumulated resources during a global economic crisis. Shifting from a procyclical to a mildly countercyclical fiscal stance has helped to smooth public investment and social expenditures across the cycle. One example of this countercyclical policy was Chile's reaction to the 2008-2009 world financial crisis. Thus, this article argues that Chile's approach contains ideas and practices that may be useful in the design of fiscal policies and institutions in other commodity-producing nations. © 2014 by Annual Reviews.",fiscal rules and the management of natural resource revenues: the case of chile,2014,Annual Review of Resource Economics,"Céspedes, L.F., Parrado, E., Velasco, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The impact of the fragmentation of executive and legislative bodies on the level and composition of government expenditure is a feature of politics that has attracted considerable attention from economists. However, previous authors have abstracted from two important concepts: ideology and intra-party politics. In this paper, we account for these two phenomena explicitly, and make two main contributions. First, we show that both intra- and inter-party ideological dispersion matter in explaining the level of sub-national public spending. Therefore, it is improper to consider parties as monolithic entities. We also show that ideological dispersion matters especially for current expenditures, and not so much for investment expenditures. To do so, we construct a panel database (2003-2010) comprising data from a survey that quantifies the policy preferences of party members who were candidates in Swiss elections. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",the impact of within-party and between-party ideological dispersion on fiscal outcomes: evidence from swiss cantonal parliaments,2014,Public Choice,"Bjedov, T., Lapointe, S., Madiès, T.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,220
"This paper shows that electoral incentives deter politicians from supporting trade liberalization. We focus on all major trade liberalization bills introduced since the early 1970s in the U.S. Congress, in which House and Senate members serve respectively two- and six-year terms and one third of senators face elections every two years. We show that senators are more likely to support trade liberalization than House representatives. However, this result does not hold for the last generation of senators, who face elections at the same time as House members, suggesting that inter-cameral differences are driven by term length. Considering senators alone, we find that the last generation is less likely to support trade liberalization than the previous two. This result is pervasive and holds both when comparing the behavior of different senators voting on the same bill and that of individual senators voting on different bills.

"Since the inception of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program in 1975, cities and large urban counties have been entitled to funding based on a formula designed to approximate community need. As with any such federally funded and locally administered program, there is a tension between federal and local control. At the federal level, one of CDBG's main goals is to benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) people and places. While a substantial literature assesses how well CDBG funds are targeted to needy recipient jurisdictions, evidence on how funds are distributed within recipient jurisdictions is much more limited. In this article, we examine the distribution of CDBG funds relative to the share of LMI people at the council-district and neighborhood levels in Chicago, Illinois, and Los Angeles, California, for 1998 - 2004. In Los Angeles, we find that relatively poorer council districts receive more than they would were funds distributed following the share of LMI people. In contrast, Chicago's relatively poorer council districts receive lower funding than predicted by their share of the LMI population. This difference across council districts within the cities is partially explained by the greater sensitivity of allocations in Chicago to the location of high-income households. Despite these disparities, policy answers are not obvious; any policy that aims to enhance CDBG's reach to LMI people must contend with the erosion of broad-based political support that this would engender. © 2014 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.",where does the bucket leak? sending money to the poor via the community development block grant program,2014,Housing Policy Debate,"Brooks, L., Sinitsyn, M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",222
"We complement the literature on distributive politics by taking a systematic look at regional favoritism in a large and diverse sample of countries and by employing a broad measure that captures the aggregate distributive effect of many different policies. In particular, we use satellite data on nighttime light intensity and information about the birthplaces of the countries' political leaders. In our panel of 38,427 subnational regions from 126 countries with yearly observations from 1992 to 2009, we find that subnational regions have more intense nighttime light when being the birth region of the current political leader. We argue that this finding provides evidence for regional favoritism. We explore the dynamics and the geographical extent of regional favoritism and show that regional favoritism is most prevalent in countries with weak political institutions and poorly educated citizens.

"Party systems diverge in their levels of nationalisation. While in some countries parties obtain similar levels of electoral support in all districts, in others parties get very asymmetric electoral shares across districts. The distributive consequences of this have been seldom studied.

This argument is tested in 22 OECD democracies for the period 1980-2006.

"When the difference between winning and losing elections is large, elites have incentives to use ethnicity to control access to spoils, mobilizing some citizens and excluding others. This paper presents a new electoral mechanism, the turn-taking institution, that could move states away from ethnically mediated patron-client politics. With this mechanism, the whole executive term goes to a sufficiently inclusive supermajority coalition; if no coalition qualifies, major coalitions take short, alternating turns several times before the next election. A decision-theoretic model shows how the turn-taking institution would make it easier for mass-level actors to coordinate on socially productive policy and policy-making processes.

"The purpose of this study is to examine how cyclical fluctuations in tax revenue affect state fiscal policies, using a state panel data set. In particular, the study develops a measure of revenue gap-the cyclical component of tax revenue-by calculating the orthogonal deviations of tax bases from the trend, and then analyzes its effects on the level of spending and taxation-as measured by expenditure gap and overall tax rate-using a dynamic panel-data model. The analyses reveal that revenue gap is positively related to expenditure gap and negatively to overall tax rate. These results clearly show the procyclical patterns of state fiscal policies and further suggest the association between revenue volatility and fiscal instability.

"Is there a way to understand why some global environmental externalities are addressed effectively, whereas others are not? The transaction costs of defining the property rights to mitigation benefits and costs is a useful framework for such analysis. This approach views international cooperation as a contractual process among country leaders to assign those property rights. Leaders cooperate when it serves domestic interests to do so. The demand for property rights comes from those who value and stand to gain from multilateral action. Property rights are supplied by international agreements that specify resource access and use, assign costs and benefits including outlining the size and duration of compensating transfer payments, and determining who will pay and who will receive them. Four factors raise the transaction costs of assigning property rights: (i) scientific uncertainty regarding mitigation benefits and costs; (ii) varying preferences and perceptions across heterogeneous populations; (iii) asymmetric information; and (iv) the extent of compliance and new entry. These factors are used to examine the role of transaction costs in the establishment and allocation of property rights to provide globally valued national parks, implement the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, execute the Montreal Protocol to manage emissions that damage the stratospheric ozone layer, set limits on harvest of highly-migratory ocean fish stocks, and control greenhouse gas emissions.",addressing global environmental externalities: transaction costs considerations,2014,Journal of Economic Literature,"Libecap, G.D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"States have traditionally offered support to their fiscally distressed municipalities. When less intrusive forms of assistance fail to bring stability, some states employ supervisory institutions that exercise approval authority over local budgets or, more intrusively, displace locally elected officials. These “takeover boards” are frequently accused of representing an antidemocratic form of local government and a denial of local autonomy.This Article suggests that the extent to which takeover boards are subject to an antidemocratic critique is frequently overstated. Those making efforts to revive near-insolvent localities cannot be oblivious to the causes that generated their distress. Depopulation, high unemployment, depleted municipal services, and blight do not arise spontaneously. They are frequently the consequence of long periods of local mismanagement, in which expenditures deviate substantially from those goods and services that residents prefer, inducing the most mobile among them to gravitate to more hospitable jurisdictions. Any viable response to such dysfunction must therefore address the causes of political dysfunction.By addressing the political underpinnings of fiscal distress, takeover boards may be more capable of satisfying the interests of local residents for public goods than local elected officials and may also represent the interests of nonresidents and creditors who are not considered by those officials. Moreover, this Article suggests the authority of takeover boards should be expanded to allow them to engage in restructuring of municipal governance in order to avoid the entrenched and fragmented institutions that are often associated with local fiscal distress. The temporary nature of takeover board jurisdiction means that when local governance returns to the realm of normal politics, residents will be in a more informed position to evaluate the optimal structure of local governance. © 2014, Columbia Law Review Association.

"Objectives: Research has shown that government spending can affect GDP growth rates, yet there is no comprehensive study that looks at how a country's choice of political institutions affects government spending. This article focuses on how the choice of regime type (presidential, parliamentary, or mixed), legislative chamber structure (bicameral or unicameral), legislative chamber size, and electoral rules affect the level of government spending. Methods: The methodology used is pooled ordinary least squares for an unbalanced panel of 92 democracies between 1975 and 2007. Results: The results show that the relationship between legislative chamber size and government spending is linear in unicameral countries but nonlinear in bicameral countries, plurality electoral rule is always associated with less spending than any other type of electoral rule, and unicameral and bicameral countries should not be modeled together. Conclusions: While countries that have long-standing political institutions are less likely to change the characteristics of those political institutions in order to change the level of government spending, the results of this article suggest that countries that are establishing new political institutions (e.g., South Sudan and Libya) stand to benefit from knowing what types of institutions are conducive for growth. © 2012 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","legislatures, leaders, and leviathans: how constitutional institutions affect the size of government spending",2013,Social Science Quarterly,"Maldonado, B.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,230

"Many models predict that incumbent legislators use government spending - ""pork barrel"" spending - to increase their vote shares in elections. To date, however, evidence for this hypothesis is scarce.

The results show that secured earmarks lead to higher vote shares.

"Using a new data set on Swiss cantons since 1890, we analyze how the adoption of proportional representation affects fiscal policy. In line with economic theory, we show that proportional systems shift spending toward broad goods (like education and welfare benefits) but decrease spending on geographically targetable goods (like roads). We find little evidence that proportional representation increases the overall size of government. An analysis of the underlying theoretical mechanisms reveals that proportional representation increases electoral turnout, left-wing representation, and political fragmentation. These changes in political representation explain a substantial share of the rise in education spending, but a small share of the rise in welfare spending or the decline in road expenditures. © 2013 by the European Economic Association.","how do electoral systems affect fiscal policy? evidence from cantonal parliaments, 1890-2000",2013,Journal of the European Economic Association,"Funk, P., Gathmann, C.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",234

"This study examines whether there exists a systematic link between the size and composition of public expenditure and the political determinants across the Indian states. Three types of political determinants-forms of governments, government's ideology, and electoral cycle-are identified and three sets of hypotheses are designed linking these characteristics with three different measures of public expenditure.

"According to the political business cycle literature, survival-maximizing leaders will manipulate whatever macroeconomic policy instruments they have at their disposal in order to retain power. However, an obvious implication of the political business cycle literature has not previously been adequately tested: does having the ability to manipulate macroeconomic policy instruments actually allow leaders to stay in office longer? We argue that elected leaders who have neither fiscal nor monetary instruments available for electoral purposes will find it more difficult to survive in office. We test this claim using data from 19 OECD countries in the latter part of the twentieth century when the degree of capital mobility in the international economy was high. We find that access to macroeconomic instruments does help leaders retain office, but that these instruments are only effective for leaders who have been in office for at least 7years. © 2012 International Studies Association.",monetary institutions and the political survival of democratic leaders,2013,International Studies Quarterly,"Clark, W.R., Golder, S.N., Poast, P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Pork-barrel effects are discussed using a specific program of Portuguese investment expenditures (PIDDAC) that has been observed since 1997. My framework adds new insight to this important branch of economics literature. First, my analysis is the first to be based on sequential dictators games, which are more appropriate for studying the strategies of the agents involved in pork-barrel practices. Second, I examine the role of 'irrelevance effects', which limit or offset the pork-barrel effect even if the recipient municipality and the Portuguese government are ruled by the same political wing. My empirical estimations confirm that the Portuguese government tends to increase PIDDAC transfers to the municipalities that are being ruled by the same political wing. Municipalities with fewer residents or fewer parishes tend to suffer the most significant irrelevance effects. PIDDAC transfers to all municipalities were found to be more generous during election years. © 2013 Pion and its Licensors.",pork-barrel versus irrelevance effects in portuguese public spending,2013,Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy,"Mourao, P.R.",Scopus,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,240

"We study the impact of decentralization on sovereign default risk. Theory predicts that decentralization deteriorates fiscal discipline since subnational governments undertax/overspend, anticipating that, in the case of overindebtedness, the federal government will bail them out.

Using panel data on up to 30 emerging markets in the period 1993-2008 we confirm this hypothesis. Higher levels of fiscal and political decentralization increase sovereign default risk.

"Scholars of state politics are often interested in the causal effects of legislative institutions on policy outcomes. For example, during the 1990s a number of states adopted term limits for state legislators. Advocates of term limits argued that this institutional reform would alter state policy in a number of ways, including limiting state expenditures. We highlight a number of research design issues that complicate attempts to estimate the effect of institutions on state outcomes by addressing the question of term limits and spending. In particular, we focus on (1) treatment effect heterogeneity and (2) the suitability of nonterm-limit states as good counterfactuals for term-limit states. We compare two different identification strategies to deal with these issues: differences-in-differences (DID) estimation and conditioning on prior outcomes with an emphasis on synthetic case control. Using more rigorous methods of causal inference, we find little evidence that term limits affect state spending.

"Scholars interested in legislative processes pay relatively little attention to the changes made to bills in parliamentary democracies. On the one hand, comparative research has often described parliamentary institutions as ineffectual vis-à-vis cabinets throughout the lawmaking process; on the other hand, for a long time the rational choice literature has focused more on the formal rules regulating amendatory activity than on amendatory activity itself. Hence, very few studies have tried to explain how much government bills are altered in parliament and why. This article investigates the changes made to governmental legislation in Italy. Taking the modifications occurring during the legislative process as the dependent variable, a number of explanatory hypotheses derived from both existing scholarship and original arguments are discussed and tested. This also allows the identification of some usually unobserved aspects of the decision-making process within the cabinet. The findings can also be relevant for comparative research since Italy has been characterised during the period under scrutiny (1987-2006) by two distinct electoral systems, two extremely different party systems (pivotal and alternational), governments with various ideological orientations and range, and both partisan and technical ministers. © 2012 European Consortium for Political Research.","horses and hippos: why italian government bills change in the legislative arena, 1987-2006",2013,European Journal of Political Research,"Pedrazzani, A., Zucchini, F.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This study deals with a highly topical research issue - migrations and integration processes which are intrinsically connected with them. At the same time it strives to present a basic overview of the most important migration theories. Although a majority of them have originated outwith the discipline of history, they do represent a pathway to the clarification of the circumstances of the origins and the realization of shifts in spatial mobility of different social classes in a historical context. The presented work primarily focuses on the most recent foreign literature and introduces individual themes which are seen as exceptionally significant from the point of migrations in European history. It also introduces individual theoretical concepts; it analyses their division into macro and micro theories; it presents examples of hypotheses, their authors and even their theoretical works. This work, in its own way, is a specialised bibliography which presents a basic overview of the themes under research at the interdisciplinary level.","migration theories, integration processes and migrations in european history [přehledy bádání a historiografických studií: migrační teorie, integrační procesy a evropské dějiny migrací]",2013,Cesky Casopis Historicky,"Grulich, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper uses a panel of 22 OECD Development Assistance Committee countries to examine whether fragmentation of executive power and the degree of competition from the legislative branch of government increased the amount of tied aid over the period 1979-2009. Fragmentation is defined as the degree to which the costs of a dollar of aid expenditure are internalized by decision-makers and is measured as the number of decision-makers in government. Legislative competition is defined as the relative strength of the government in relation to the legislature. Three variables are used to capture this effect. The empirical results show tied aid, both in levels and as a percentage of total aid, increases as the number of decision-makers within the government increases, and decreases as the proportion of excess seats a governing coalition holds above a simple majority increases. © 2013 Oxford Department of International Development.",political power and aid-tying practices in the development assistance committee countries,2013,Oxford Development Studies,"Pincin, J.A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Over the past decade, a number of state and local governments have amended land use regulations to permit the accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) on single-family lots. Measured by raw numbers of reforms, the campaign to secure legal reforms permitting ADUs appears to be a tremendous success. The question remains, however, whether these reforms overcome the well-documented land-use parochialism that has, for decades, represented a primary obstacle to increasing the supply of affordable housing. In order to understand more about their actual effects, this Article examines ADU reforms in a context which ought to predict a minimal level of local parochialism. In 2002, California enacted state-wide legislation mandating that local governments either amend their zoning laws to permit ADUs in single-family zones or accept the imposition of a state-dictated regulatory regime. We carefully examined the zoning law of all California cities with populations over 50,000 people (150 total cities) to determine how local governments actually implemented ADU reforms “on the ground” after the state legislation was enacted. Our analysis suggests that the seeming success story masks hidden local regulatory barriers. Local governments have responded to local political pressures by delaying the enactment of ADU legislation (and, in a few cases, simply refusing to do so despite the state mandate), imposing burdensome procedural requirements that are contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the state-law requirement that ADUs be permitted “as of right,” requiring multiple off-street parking spaces, and imposing substantive and procedural design requirements. Taken together, these details likely dramatically suppress the value of ADUs as a means of increasing affordable housing.",a room of one's own? accessory dwelling unit reforms and local parochialism,2013,British Journal of Canadian Studies,"Brinig, M.F., Garnett, N.S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Electoral institutions should systematically affect the propensity of a country to rely and spend on distributive measures. Supporting evidence is however still rare because of the difficulty in finding comparable cross-national data, the employment of dummy variables to account for the electoral systems, and the failure to recognise the interacting effects of different electoral rules on policy outcomes. Employing national data on state aid expenditure and a number of measures across European Union countries, the article provides evidence that legislators elected in higher magnitude districts spend less. More interestingly, it shows the interlocking policy effects of electoral institutions. Where high district magnitude is combined with ballot control, party-based voting and pooling, these rules conjunctly dampen politicians' incentives to cultivate a personal vote and lead to lower spending on, and use of, distributive measures. Where high district magnitude is not combined with these rules, results are inconclusive. With one exception though, if leaders do not have control over the ballot rank, higher magnitude increases reliance on distributive measures. Results are robust to several alternative political-economy explanations of fiscal policy outcomes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",electoral institutions and distributive policies in parliamentary systems: an application to state aid measures in eu countries,2013,West European Politics,"Franchino, F., Mainenti, M.",Scopus,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,249
"We inventory more than 150 studies of distributive politics in more than three dozen countries other than the United States. We organize existing studies under two theories: theories of democratic accountability and theories of government responsiveness. Studies that concern democratic accountability conceptualize distributive allocations as attempts by politicians to protect themselves electorally by targeting specific groups of voters. We identify four subsets: (a) studies of whether politicians target goods to core or swing voters; (b) studies of general political favoritism in targeting government goods; (c) studies of whether goods are disbursed according to the electoral cycle; and (d) studies of whether elected officials gain votes from the disbursement of government goods. We illustrate each with examples from the literature. We then discuss distributive politics as responsiveness to the median voter. This perspective entails a focus on the redistributive consequences of government policy and investigates whether special interests capture a disproportionate share of goods coming from government. To illustrate the utility of both perspectives, we analyze original data on electricity provision in India's largest state. Copyright © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

"Crony capitalism is a popular term, which is used to describe rent seeking, regulatory capture, political entrepreneurship, and interest-group politics, have been analyzed. Cronies support their partners in government in exchange for the benefits they receive from government. Pro-government, anticapitalist arguments point to capitalism's abuses and argue that big government is necessary to protect against market failures, to regulate business so it will act in the public interest, and to stand up to crony capitalism. The problem with the pro-government argument is that crony capitalism is actually a product of big government. The increased government involvement in the economy that the big-government advocates promote ends up increasing crony capitalism, not controlling it, and hence leads to calls for even more government intervention.

"I consider a heterogeneous federal system in which policy coordination is desirable but underprovided in the absence of a federal intervention. To improve policy coordination, the federal layer can intervene by imposing bounds on local policies. These federal bounds define a restricted policy space within which local jurisdictions have residual discretion. I analyze a voting game in which the federal bounds are determined directly by the citizens via federal majority rule. The voting equilibrium exhibits various forms of inefficiencies. When the distribution of voters' ideal policy is skewed in one direction, the federal bounds are biased in the opposite direction. When the gains from policy coordination are negligible, local discretion is too limited, and a majority of voters are worse-off with the federal intervention than without. When policy coordination is more important, the federal intervention is supported by a majority of voters, but contrary to the received wisdom, it is socially worse than no intervention. Hence, the model shows that inadequate and excessively rigid federal interventions can emerge in a democratic federation without agency costs or informational imperfections. © 2013 A.

"This paper examines the incentives of voters to appoint legislators with different preferences from their own. The paper adopts an underlying legislative bargaining model proposed by Volden and Wiseman (2007) in which legislators with heterogeneous preferences divide a fixed budget between a public good and pork projects (local public goods). We show that voters have an incentive to strategically delegate to affect how the budget is divided at the legislative level. When voters' preferences for pork are not too strong, the incentives for strategic delegation exist to appoint representatives who will direct more money to the public good and not to pork projects. This generally results in at least as many representatives as districts that favor the public good. The comparative statics predict that when strategic delegation occurs, increasing the size of the legislature increases the fraction of the budget spent on the public good. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",strategic delegation in a legislative bargaining model with pork and public goods,2013,Journal of Public Economics,"Christiansen, N.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Congressional districts create two levels of representation. Studies of representation focus on a disaggregated level: the electoral connection between representatives and constituents. But there is a collective level of representation-the result of aggregating across representatives. This article uses new measures of home styles to demonstrate that responsiveness to constituents can have negative consequences for collective representation. The electoral connection causes marginal representatives-legislators with districts composed of the other party's partisans-to emphasize appropriations in their home styles. But it causes aligned representatives-those with districts filled with copartisans-to build their home styles around position taking. Aggregated across representatives, this results in an artificial polarization in stated party positions: aligned representatives, who tend to be ideologically extreme, dominate policy debates. The logic and evidence in this article provide an explanation for the apparent rise in vitriolic debate, and the new measures facilitate a literature on home styles. ©2013, Midwest Political Science Association.",appropriators not position takers: the distorting effects of electoral incentives on congressional representation,2013,American Journal of Political Science,"Grimmer, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",259
"Strong rhetorical differences between the European Union and the United States on climate matters have been evident for almost two decades.

First, the agenda-setting privileges of their policy-makers are significantly different, influencing how agenda setters shape policies and link issues, such as energy and climate policy. Second, while issue linkage has helped overcome distributional obstacles in the EU, it has led to more complexity and greater policy obstacles in the US. Finally, legislative rules, procedures, and norms have constrained the coalition-building efforts of lawmakers in the two systems in different ways, affecting negotiation processes and outcomes.

"Scholars blame high levels of ethnic heterogeneity for many social and political ills, including poor economic growth, corruption, and policy gridlock.

"Legislators and legislative parties must strike a balance between collective and member-level goals. While there are legislative and reputational returns to co-ordinated behavior, partisan loyalty has a detrimental effect on members' electoral success.

This study tests our theory by examining US House members' likelihood of voting with their party on both partisan and non-divisive votes during the course of the election cycle in order to assess whether members strategically alter their levels of party loyalty as elections approach. It also explores whether majority parties strategically structure the agenda according to variation in members' electoral constraints. This approach allows elite partisanship to follow a dynamic process, which is referred to here as dynamic elite partisanship. The results demonstrate that as elections approach, members are less likely to cast party votes, and parties are less inclined to schedule votes that divide the parties.

"Although the speed at which governmental initiatives are approved by parliament can influence the effectiveness of the executive and the accountability of the political system, scholars have devoted scarce attention to the duration of parliamentary processes. This article focuses on the legislative production of Italian cabinets, and aims at investigating the conditions that enable governments to have a rapid enactment for their initiatives, and those that lengthen parliamentary proceedings. Studying the length of the legislative process allows us to understand how the opposition members use their ability to delay the passage of government bills. In this regard, the Italian case enables to explore the differences between a pivotal and consensual system (the First Republic), and an alternational and potentially majoritarian one (the Second Republic). The other hypotheses evaluated concern the dynamics within the governing coalition, and the mutual exchange of votes among legislators. Hypotheses are tested by using original data on the legislation introduced by the Italian governments between 1987 and 2006. The adopted research strategy treats the legislative process as a sequence of stages, each one with its own logic and peculiar explanatory factors. The results do not indicate any impact of the policy divisions between government and opposition.

"Spurred by the disconnect between what was being taught in the classroom and actual practice, Godwin, Ainsworth, and Godwin set out to answer the question, Was political science missing some key aspects of the interactions between lobbyists and policy makers? Built on interviews with over 100 lobbyists, these authors show that much of the research on organized interests overlooks the lobbying of regulatory agencies even though it accounts for almost half of all lobbying even though bureaucratic agencies have considerable leeway in the how they choose to implement law. This groundbreaking new book argues that lobbying activity is not mainly a struggle among competing interests over highly collective goods; rather, it's the public provision of private goods. And more to the point, this shift in understanding influences our perception of the strengths and weaknesses of American democracy. Through a series of highly readable case studies, the authors employ both neo pluralist and exchange perspectives to explore the lobbying activity that occurs in the later stages of the policymaking process which are typically less partisan, involve little conflict, and receive scant public attention.

Growth in legislation is found to be negatively related to growth in real income per capita in the short-run, implying that legislation responds to temporary economic shocks, but without a robust long-run relationship with the level of income. The growth in the number of pages of legislation enacted and legislative complexity also show a negative short-run relationship with growth in real national income per capita and a positive long-run relationship with the level of income. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",federal legislative activism in australia: a new approach to testing wagner's law,2012,Public Choice,"Kirchner, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The main question of the paper, in the context of European economic governance reforms, is to assess whether strengthening fiscal institutions will resolve the problem of budgetary imbalances in countries prone to the deficit bias. The central argument is that the commitment behind the institutional changes-signaled by the composition of fiscal consolidation and the role of external actors-is critical for the success of reforms. In order to examine this thesis the contrasting experiences of Hungary and Slovakia are analyzed. While both have struggled with fiscal imbalances and eventually introduced far-reaching institutional reforms, these were successful in Slovakia while reversed in Hungary. The major implication of these cases is that changes in fiscal management cannot be treated as mere technicalities and are inseparable from the broader economic policy agenda. In countries where short-term considerations dominate decision-making, rules are implemented only under strong external pressure and are likely to be circumvented.",from discretion to rules? the fate of budgetary management reforms in slovakia and hungary,2012,Society and Economy,"Gyorffy, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A diverse and growing literature ties legislative professionalization and power to career paths. In particular, higher rates of reelection and longer legislative careers should produce more professional, competent, and high-quality legislatures. Legislators have more incentives to strengthen their own institution when they intend to remain there for a long career. Using data from the most recent constitutional convention in Brazil, we show that legislators with greater prospects for long careers were actually less likely to support strengthening the legislative branch.

"In this paper we examine the impact of tax contracts as a novel institution on elections, policies, and welfare. We consider a political game in which three parties compete to form the government and voters may behave strategically. Parties have policy preferences about the level of public-good provision and benefit from perks when in office. A government raises taxes for both purposes. We show that tax contracts yield moderate policies and lead to lower perks by avoiding the formation of grand coalitions in order to win government.

"Several transition economies have undertaken fiscal decentralization reforms over the past two decades along with liberalization, privatization and stabilization reforms. Theory predicts that decentralization may aggravate fiscal imbalances, unless the right incentives are in place to promote fiscal discipline. This study uses a panel of 20 transition countries over 19years to address a central question of fact: Did privatization help to promote local governments' fiscal discipline? The answer is clearly 'no' for privatization considered in isolation. However, privatization and subnational fiscal autonomy along with reforms to the banking system - restraining access to soft financing - may prove effective at improving fiscal balances among local governments. © 2012 The Author.

"This article analyzes the recent budget challenges that have prompted examination of the role of state and fiscal institutions such as balanced budget rules, tax and expenditure limits, debt restriction, and ""rainy-day,"" or budget stabilization, funds. Some commentators argue that stronger fiscal rules could have helped avert the 2008-2011 (and, still continuing) state and local budget crises. Others contend that rules already in force have exacerbated the budgetary effects of the Great Recession and that continuing with them as currently structured will not only make more difficult fiscal recovery but will also undermine the traditional role of the states in the federal system. California's demonstration of how such institutions can take a state from fiscal health and stability to near bankruptcy is a dramatic case, especially for those critics who are currently making the argument that institutions can lead to particularly severe unintended consequences. In contrast, as this article notes, legislatively imposed institutions, if well designed, can lead to increased public and social accountability. © 2012 by Oxford University Press.

"The most recent round of state budget crises has resulted in calls to permit states to file for bankruptcy in order to restructure and reduce their financial obligations. This Article argues that these proposals are misguided because states' financial distress is primarily a political problem created by ""fiscal federalism""-the financial relationship between the federal government and the states-and exacerbated by political agency problems. Accordingly, state bankruptcy proposals need to be evaluated in political, rather than financial, terms. Bankruptcy can no more remake fiscal federalism than it can fix a firm with an untenable business model. While bankruptcy might provide a tool for mitigating political agency problems, either as a forum for negotiation or as a ""penalty default rule"" that would encourage political settlements outside of bankruptcy, it is more likely to be used to provide judicial cover for partisan agendas. Attempts to use bankruptcy to solve political problems invite a reevaluation of the ""creditors' bargain,"" the dominant theory of bankruptcy law, which argues that bankruptcy law tries to replicate the bargain that creditors would have made themselves. This Article argues that ""contractarian"" approaches to bankruptcy are necessarily incomplete because they do not account for the politics of bankruptcy. Instead, this Article sketches out a new theory of bankruptcy law as the dynamic ""armistice line"" between competing interest groups. Bankruptcy is fundamentally a distributional exercise, and the shape of bankruptcy law is an expression of distributional norms and interest group politics rather than an exercise in economic efficiency. A proper theoretical understanding of bankruptcy must therefore commence from a political, rather than economic, perspective.",bankrupt politics and the politics of bankruptcy,2012,Cornell Law Review,"Levitin, A.J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Models that analyze policies to promote economic growth differ from models that describe the optimal distribution of income or the optimal policy for internalizing an externality. The omniscient benevolent dictator is often represented in economic analysis as the planner's problem. The analyst derives the conditions required for an optimal allocation of resources, and the planner's problem is to create those conditions. The policy problem is couched entirely in comparative-static terms, identifying the optimal outcome and the status quo, with policy recommendations intended to change the situation from the latter to the former. Even with sufficient information, public policy might not be made in the public interest because the people who are making the policy may not have an incentive to act in the public interest.

Tobit regressions of the allocation patterns in 419 local districts in Germany for the period 2000-6 suggest the following: although recipient sub-state governments enjoy substantial discretion in selecting projects, their distributive choices are largely in accord with European goals.

"Do electoral rules affect the progress of economic reforms? The students of economic reform have examined the effects of inter-party competition, partly shaped by electoral rules, on economic reform, but have neglected the more direct effects of electoral rules, namely the extent to which they encourage the personal vote. More broadly, studies of the effect of electoral rules on economic policy have relied on the simplistic SMD/PR distinction and have neglected features of electoral institutions that affect the level of intra-party competition. Building on the personal vote literature, we argue that electoral institutions that encourage the personal vote are not conducive to reform progress. We provide the first systematic multivariate cross-country test of the implications of the personal vote literature for economic reform in the context of the post-communist countries from 1990 to 2006.

"Most empirical evidence indicates voters penalize deficits and spending growth. Contrary to this dominant finding, a few recent studies conclude that voters reward public spending. We reconcile these conflicting findings, positing that the structure of fiscal federalism in countries like Argentina causes voters to reward fiscal expansion because they perceive that this extra spending at the margin is not financed by them, but rather by the nation at large. We provide evidence and microfoundations for the electoral connection implicit in this argument: voters reward public spending when they can pass the cost on to someone else (e.g., as in Argentina), and punish it otherwise (e.g., as in the United States). © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",voters as fiscal liberals: incentives and accountability in federal systems,2012,Economics and Politics,"Jones, M.P., Meloni, O., Tommasi, M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Models are ubiquitous in political science research. Although game theory models, statistical models, and even non-mathematical models are common in the discipline, the field lacks a coherent foundation for understanding the role models play in scientific inquiry. In A Model Discipline, Kevin Clarke and David Primo challenge the conventional wisdom that theoretical models must be tested by statistical models in order to be useful, and they provide an alternative account for understanding the role of models in political science. In Clarke and Primo's account, models are tools, like maps, and should be evaluated based on whether they are useful for a specific purpose, not based on whether they are ""true"" or ""false."" After tracing the historical roots of modern political science and offering their alternative account, the authors then detail the many uses for theoretical and statistical models, providing examples from across the discipline. They also show why that one common use of statistical models, the empirical testing of formal models, is doomed to fail. Clarke and Primo go on to argue that another goal of science, explanation, does justify the combination of theoretical and empirical models.

"What factors determine the nature of political opportunism in local government in South India? To answer this question, we study two types of policy decisions that have been delegated to local politicians-beneficiary selection for transfer programs and the allocation of within-village public goods. Our data on village councils in South India show that, relative to other citizens, elected councillors are more likely to be selected as beneficiaries of a large transfer program. The chief councillor's village also obtains more public goods, relative to other villages.

"The early American political theorists could not have anticipated the country's current fiscal problems, but also they were hardly ignorant of the possibility. Sovereigns have commonly defaulted throughout history. The key is to constrain government spending and deficits. One constraint is a broad tax base, a constraint that was largely applicable in the United States until the Sixteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution, permitting collection of income taxes without regard to the enumeration of the population. The decreasing share of tax liability borne by low-income households and the increasing share of tax liability borne by high-income households are clearly associated with greater government debt and entitlement spending. It is believed that a fundamental restructuring of the tax code is essential if the U.S. government is to bring down its debt and curb entitlement spending.",taxpayers and tax spenders: does a zero tax priee matter?,2012,Independent Review,"Lipford, J.W., Yandle, B.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A large population of voters with single-peaked preferences are partitioned into disjoint constituencies. Collective decisions are taken by their representatives, one from each constituency, according to a weighted voting rule. It is assumed that each representative's ideal point perfectly matches that of the respective constituency median and that top-tier decisions are in the voting game's core. The resulting representative-democratic voting outcomes generally differ from those of a direct-democratic, single-tier system. The expected discrepancy varies with the voting weight allocation. It is minimized by weights proportional to constituency population sizes only if citizens differ sufficiently more between than within constituencies.

"More than two years after the official end of the Great Recession, state governments still face significant budget deficits that cannot be addressed without further drastic spending cuts or substantial revenue increases. The structural origins of the ongoing state fiscal crisis are well known. Excessively procyclical revenue structures, combined with spending obligations that increase with economic downturns, have resulted in a budget dynamic for the states that is not sustainable over the long term. The consensus solution to this problem is for states to save money during boom times (via budget stabilization or ""rainy day"" funds) and to draw on those savings during recessions. Unfortunately, numerous studies have shown that states do not save anywhere close to an adequate amount for this to be an effective strategy. As a result, during each of the past several downturns, states have turned to the federal government for fiscal assistance-often derisively termed ""bailouts""-to address fiscal imbalances. Yet these bailouts have their own problems, including creating an incentive for states not to establish adequate rainy day funds, which in turn increases the likelihood of future bailout demands. To escape from this vicious cycle, we propose a set of federal policy reforms to facilitate state savings. We offer a menu of policy options, rather than a single solution, because we argue that existing evidence does not clearly explain why states do not save. Therefore, we first analyze the possible sources of failure and then tailor a number of remedies for each; in nearly all cases, it is clear that states would be unable to overcome the problem on their own, making federal intervention particularly apt.

"How do we know whether a country suffers from vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI)? What should be done about it? Academic appreciation of these issues in general, and the nature of political behaviour in particular, both have major implications for the way federations are fiscally structured. While the latter clearly is a problem of political negotiations, our focus is on the former, that is, conceptual clarity, which precedes meaningful negotiations. Thus, the paper aims to clarify the multiple usages of the symbolically loaded terms VFI and VFG (vertical fiscal gap) by critically engaging the fundamental assumptions and premises underlying these ostensibly similar notions. It proposes an alternative conceptual framework and introduces the concepts of vertical fiscal asymmetry (VFA) and vertical fiscal difference (VFD) that have the potential to better structure public debate on issues of vertical fiscal relations and stimulate a sensible appreciation of the problem and possible remedies. © 2011 The Author.

"Access Points develops a new theory about how democratic institutions influence policy outcomes. Access Point Theory argues that the more points of access that institutions provide to interest groups, the cheaper lobbying will be, and, thus, the more lobbying will occur. This will lead to more complex policy, as policymakers insert specific provisions to benefit special interests, and, if one side of the debate has a lobbying advantage, to more biased policy, as the advantaged side is able to better take advantage of the cheaper lobbying. This book then uses Access Point Theory to explain why some countries have more protectionist and more complex trade policies than others; why some countries have stronger environmental and banking regulations than others; and why some countries have more complicated tax codes than others. In policy area after policy area, this book finds that more access points lead to more biased and more complex policy.

"With the end of the Cold War, the International Monetary Fund emerged as the most powerful international institution in history. But how much influence can the IMF exert over fiercely contested issues in domestic politics that affect the lives of millions? In Lending Credibility, Randall Stone develops the first systematic approach to answering this question. Deploying an arsenal of methods from a range of social sciences rarely combined, he mounts a forceful challenge to conventional wisdom. Focusing on the former Soviet bloc, Stone finds that the IMF is neither as powerful as some critics fear, nor as weak as others believe, but that the answer hinges on the complex factor of how much credibility it can muster from country to country. Stone begins by building a formal, game-theoretic model of lending credibility, which he then subjects to sophisticated quantitative testing on original data from twenty-six countries over the 1990s. Next come detailed, interview-based case studies on negotiations between the IMF and Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Bulgaria. Stone asserts that the IMF has exerted startling influence over economic policy in smaller countries, such as Poland and Bulgaria. However, where U.S. foreign policy interests come more heavily into play, as in Russia, the IMF cannot credibly commit to enforcing the loans-for-policy contract. This erodes its ability to facilitate enduring market reforms. Stone's context is the postcommunist transition in Europe and Asia, but his findings carry implications for IMF activities the world over. © 2002 by Princeton University Press.

"Whereas the US President signed the Kyoto Protocol, the failure of the US Congress to ratify it seriously hampered subsequent international climate cooperation. This recent US trend, of signing environmental treaties but failing to ratify them, could thwart attempts to come to a future climate agreement. Two complementary explanations of this trend are proposed. First, the political system of the US has distinct institutional features that make it difficult for presidents to predict whether the Senate will give its advice and consent to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and whether Congress will pass the required enabling legislation. Second, elected for a fixed term, US presidents might benefit politically from supporting MEAs even when knowing that legislative support is not forthcoming. Four policy implications are explored, concerning the scope for unilateral presidential action, the potential for bipartisan congressional support, the effectiveness of a treaty without the US, and the prospects for a deep, new climate treaty. Policy relevance Why does the failure of US ratification of multilateral environmental treaties occur? This article analyses the domestic political mechanisms involved in cases of failed US ratification. US non-participation in global environmental institutions often has serious ramifications. For example, it sharply limited Kyoto's effectiveness and seriously hampered international climate negotiations for years. Although at COP 17 in Durban the parties agreed to negotiate a new agreement by 2015, a new global climate treaty may well trigger a situation resembling the one President Clinton faced in 1997 when he signed Kyoto but never obtained support for it in the Senate.

"Since 1994, China's central government has implemented a sequence of fiscal recentralization measures to increase its equalization capacity and reduce regional income disparities. However, the effect of intergovernmental transfers on equalization has been called into question by anecdotal evidence that seems to suggest that transfers from the center are not rule-based and are subject to heavy rent-seeking. Unlike past studies, which have focused on the equalization effects of total fiscal transfers from the center, this paper includes an examination of the equalization effects of different types of transfers because some transfers, which are inherently anti-equalizing, may mask the equalization effects of other types of transfers when they are lumped together to find the ""average"" effect. Using inequality measures, a decomposition of fiscal disparities, and dynamic panel data models, we find that China's intergovernmental transfer system that was established in 1994 does have some equalizing elements. To a large extent, these elements exist due to the mechanism designed to shrink the tax rebates that bear the legacy of the pre-1994 system; to a small extent, these elements exist due to the rule-based general-purpose transfer whose share in total transfers remains small but has increased since 2002. However, the equalization effects of the largest component of transfers, specific-purpose transfers, are anti-equalizing. They are typically not rule-based and thus subject to political influence. As a result, total transfers also exhibit significant anti-equalization effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",are intergovernmental transfers in china equalizing?,2012,China Economic Review,"Huang, B., Chen, K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper investigates the impact of corruption on economic growth in the Italian regions. We estimate a dynamic growth model for the period 1980-2004 addressing both the potential bias of the measures of corruption and the endogeneity between corruption and economic development. We find strong evidence of a negative correlation between corruption and growth. Moreover, since government intervention has been traditionally used to reduce income differentials between the northern and the southern regions, we also analyse the interaction between corruption and government expenditure.

"This book demonstrates the consequences of legislators’ strategic communication for representation in American politics. Representational Style in Congress shows how legislators present their work to cultivate constituent support. Using a massive new data set of texts from legislators and new statistical techniques to analyze the texts, this book provides comprehensive measures of what legislators say to constituents and explains why legislators adopt these styles. Using the new measures, Justin Grimmer shows how legislators affect how constituents evaluate their representatives and the consequences of strategic statements for political discourse. The introduction of new statistical techniques for political texts allows a more comprehensive and systematic analysis of what legislators say and why it matters than was previously possible. Using these new techniques, the book makes the compelling case that to understand political representation, we must understand what legislators say to constituents. © Justin Grimmer 2013.",representational style in congress: what legislators say and why it matters,2012,Representational Style in Congress: What Legislators Say and Why it Matters,"Grimmer, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"1This paper presents an empirical analysis of what drives congressional legislation on terrorism during the period 1995 to 2010. We utilize and augment current methodology to compile and analyze data on sponsorship and cosponsorship of terrorism related data. Our results on the sources of legislation on terrorism are largely in line with past examinations of the importance of committee membership and leadership, party majority-ship, and other political factors. Further, we find that the most significant and robust drive for legislation on terrorism is the September 11 th attacks. And while the impact of 9/11 affected legislative productivity everywhere, we find that it most significantly affected states surrounding New York and Washington D.C. Our results indicate that the economy may be one factor motivating politicians to legislate on terrorism; however, these results are not robust. 1This research was funded in part by a grant from the Lowe Institute of Political Economy.

"Using new historical data from Swiss cantons, we estimate the effect of direct democracy on government spending. We use fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity and new instruments to address potential endogeneity concerns. We find that direct democracy constrains canton spending but its effect is more modest than previously suggested. The instrumental variable estimates show that a mandatory budget referendum reduces canton expenditures by 12%. Lowering signature requirements for the voter initiative by 1% reduces canton spending by 0.6%.

"The traditional theory of urban finance argues against local redistribution of wealth on the assumption that such action is likely to chase away the relatively wealthy, leaving only the impoverished behind. Nevertheless, Clayton P. Gillette observes, local governments engage in substantial redistribution, both to the wealthy and to the poor. In this thoughtful book, Gillette examines whether recent campaigns to enact living wage ordinances and other local redistributive programs represent gaps in the traditional theory or political opportunism. He then investigates the role of the courts in distinguishing between these explanations. The author argues that courts have greater capacity to review local programs than is typically assumed. He concludes that when a single interest group dominates the political process, judicial intervention to determine a program's legal validity may be appropriate. But if the political contest involves competing groups, courts should defer to local political judgments. © 2011 by Yale University.

"While research and development (R&D) expenditure is crucial in a nation's competitive advantage, factors determining levels of public investment in R&D have yet to be examined. This article seeks to fill this void, focusing on different democratic institutions such as presidential versus parliamentary systems, majoritarian versus proportional electoral systems, federal versus unitary systems, bicameral versus unicameral legislatures, and the effective number of parties. Building upon theories of political institutions and government size and utilizing public R&D appropriations data from 18 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries between 1981 and 2007, this article reports that democratic institutions do matter in the levels of public R&D spending. However, the effect is more complicated across the different types and performers of research than expected. Additionally, the effect of one institutional dimension is found to be moderated by the existence of the other dimensions, which makes it clearly more challenging to sort out different degrees and directions of the relationships between R&D expenditures and political institutions. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",political institutions and public r &amp; d expenditures in democratic countries,2011,International Journal of Public Administration,"Kim, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",307
"The relationship between income distribution and economic growth has long been an important economic research subject. Despite substantial evidence on the negative impact on long-term growth of inequality in the literature, however, there is not much consensus on the specific channels through which inequality affects growth. The empirical validity of two most prominent political economy channels - redistributive fiscal spending and taxes, and sociopolitical instability - has recently been challenged. We advance a new political economy channel for the negative link between inequality and growth, a fiscal policy volatility channel, and present strong supporting econometric evidence in a large sample of countries over the period of 1960-2000. Our finding also sheds light on another commonly observed negative relation between macroeconomic volatility and growth.

"There is a widespread belief, among both political scientists and government policymakers, that ""democracies don't fight each other."" Here Joanne Gowa challenges that belief. In a thorough, systematic critique, she shows that, while democracies were less likely than other states to engage each other in armed conflicts between 1945 and 1980, they were just as likely to do so as were other states before 1914. Thus, no reason exists to believe that a democratic peace will survive the end of the Cold War. Since U.S. foreign policy is currently directed toward promoting democracy abroad, Gowa's findings are especially timely and worrisome. Those who assert that a democratic peace exists typically examine the 1815-1980 period as a whole. In doing so, they conflate two very different historical periods: the pre-World War I and post-World War II years. Examining these periods separately, Gowa shows that a democratic peace prevailed only during the later period. Given the collapse of the Cold War world, her research calls into question both the conclusions of previous researchers and the wisdom of present U.S. foreign policy initiatives. By re-examining the arguments and data that have been used to support beliefs about a democratic peace, Joanne Gowa has produced a thought-provoking book that is sure to be controversial. © 2012 by Princeton University Press.

"What is good government? Why do some governments fail? How do you implement political accountability in practice? What incentives do you need to put in place to ensure that politicians and public servants act in the public interest and not their own? These questions and many more are addressed in this book of intriguing Lindahl lectures. Economic analyses of government usually divide into two broad camps. One that emphasises government as a force for public good, which can regulate markets, distribute resources, and generally work towards improving the lives of its citizens. The other sees government as driven by private interests, susceptible to those with the power to influence its decisions, and failing to incentivise its officials to act for the greater public good. This book adopts a middle way between the two extremes, the Publius approach, which recognises the potential for government to act for the public good, but also accepts the fact that things often go wrong. It shares the view that there are certain institutional preconditions for effective government, but then proceeds to examine exactly what those preconditions are. The author emphasises that it is not just about designing an appropriate institutional framework, but also about understanding the way incentives work and the process by which the political class is selected. © T.

"This paper examines the effects of the most recent U. S. housing bubble on the fiscal policy of California cities. We use an instrumental variables approach that helps isolate the fiscal consequences of house price appreciation by taking advantage of the influence of local topological constraints on the elasticity of house prices with respect to interest rates. Our analysis generates three main findings. First, despite Prop 13 fiscal constraints, rapid house price appreciation has a strong effect on property tax revenue. Second, the resulting increase in property tax revenue was largely offset by a reduction in other local tax revenue. This offsetting response leaves total city expenditure unrelated to local house prices. In that sense the housing bubble did not produce local fiscal bubbles. Third, we find that fiscal adjustments to house price appreciation depend on local political institutions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",do housing bubbles generate fiscal bubbles?,2011,Public Choice,"Vlaicu, R., Whalley, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper uses a simple dynamic model where a government performs three functions: taxation, public spending and contract enforcement to study pathologies in resource allocation by government. A key feature of the approach is that states may invest in their future capacities to raise taxes and protect property rights. Three types of state are shown to be possible in this framework: common-interest states, redistributive states and weak states whose emergence depends on the nature of political institutions. We consider both Pigouvian and Wicksellian benchmarks against which to compare different outcomes that might arise in political equilibrium. The paper argues for a greater focus on weak government and points out that a failure to generate Wicksellian unanimity lies behind them. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",pathologies of the state,2011,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,"Besley, T.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Conventional wisdom is that during the second half of the twentieth century, Japanese Diet members served as ""pipelines"" between the national treasury and their constituents. This article employs two identification strategies to estimate how much individual Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) incumbents in the Lower House of the Diet influenced the distribution of government transfers during the period 1977 to 1992. The first exploits the changes in representation following the midterm deaths of Japanese representatives. The second uses the discontinuity in LDP representation when LDP candidates win or lose elections by very narrow margins. Overall, the influence of individual representatives on central-to-locality transfers is relatively small. However, the LDP incumbents who win office by small electoral margins do appear to affect per capita central government transfers to the municipalities where the incumbent had substantial electoral support. © Copyright Southern Political Science Association 2011.",do individual representatives influence government transfers? evidence from japan,2011,Journal of Politics,"Hirano, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"No consensus has yet emerged on whether fiscal decentralization facilitates or impedes the growth of the public sector. One explanation for this ambiguity in the literature is that the effect of fiscal decentralization on public sector size depends on the government's ideology.

"What accounts for the substantial variation in the temporal volatility of economic growth rates in democratic regimes? We claim that institutional differences between the majoritarian and proportional representation (PR) electoral systems explain why growth volatility is high in some democracies, but not others. Specifically, we suggest that unlike PR democracies, the pronounced career concerns of policymakers in majoritarian systems give them incentives to use their discretionary spending power to alter government spending levels sharply, which generates higher spending volatility in these countries. As a result, policymakers in majoritarian systems cannot credibly commit themselves to stabilizing spending levels. This causes uncertainty among economic actors about future spending levels and leads to unstable investment patterns that generate a higher volatility of growth rates in majoritarian democracies. Results from statistical models provide robust statistical support for our theoretical predictions. © The Author(s) 2011.",electoral institutions and growth volatility: theory and evidence,2011,International Political Science Review,"Béjar, S., Mukherjee, B.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The greatest obstacle to sound economic policy is not entrenched special interests or rampant lobbying, but the popular misconceptions, irrational beliefs, and personal biases held by ordinary voters. This is economist Bryan Caplan's sobering assessment in this provocative and eye-opening book. Caplan argues that voters continually elect politicians who either share their biases or else pretend to, resulting in bad policies winning again and again by popular demand. Boldly calling into question our most basic assumptions about American politics, Caplan contends that democracy fails precisely because it does what voters want. Through an analysis of Americans' voting behavior and opinions on a range of economic issues, he makes the convincing case that noneconomists suffer from four prevailing biases: they underestimate the wisdom of the market mechanism, distrust foreigners, undervalue the benefits of conserving labor, and pessimistically believe the economy is going from bad to worse. Caplan lays out several bold ways to make democratic government work better--for example, urging economic educators to focus on correcting popular misconceptions and recommending that democracies do less and let markets take up the slack. The Myth of the Rational Voter takes an unflinching look at how people who vote under the influence of false beliefs ultimately end up with government that delivers lousy results. With the upcoming presidential election season drawing nearer, this thought-provoking book is sure to spark a long-overdue reappraisal of our elective system. © 2007 by Princeton University Press.

"In the 1930s, fewer than one in one hundred U.S. labor union members were African American. By 1980, the figure was more than one in five. Black and Blue explores the politics and history that led to this dramatic integration of organized labor. In the process, the book tells a broader story about how the Democratic Party unintentionally sowed the seeds of labor's decline. The labor and civil rights movements are the cornerstones of the Democratic Party, but for much of the twentieth century these movements worked independently of one another. Paul Frymer argues that as Democrats passed separate legislation to promote labor rights and racial equality they split the issues of class and race into two sets of institutions, neither of which had enough authority to integrate the labor movement. From this division, the courts became the leading enforcers of workplace civil rights, threatening unions with bankruptcy if they resisted integration. The courts' previously unappreciated power, however, was also a problem: in diversifying unions, judges and lawyers enfeebled them financially, thus democratizing through destruction. Sharply delineating the double-edged sword of state and legal power, Black and Blue chronicles an achievement that was as problematic as it was remarkable, and that demonstrates the deficiencies of race- and class-based understandings of labor, equality, and power in America. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

"Political scientists have long classified systems of government as parliamentary or presidential, two-party or multiparty, and so on. But such distinctions often fail to provide useful insights. For example, how are we to compare the United States, a presidential bicameral regime with two weak parties, to Denmark, a parliamentary unicameral regime with many strong parties? Veto Players advances an important, new understanding of how governments are structured. The real distinctions between political systems, contends George Tsebelis, are to be found in the extent to which they afford political actors veto power over policy choices. Drawing richly on game theory, he develops a scheme by which governments can thus be classified. He shows why an increase in the number of ""veto players,"" or an increase in their ideological distance from each other, increases policy stability, impeding significant departures from the status quo. Policy stability affects a series of other key characteristics of polities, argues the author. For example, it leads to high judicial and bureaucratic independence, as well as high government instability (in parliamentary systems). The propositions derived from the theoretical framework Tsebelis develops in the first part of the book are tested in the second part with various data sets from advanced industrialized countries, as well as analysis of legislation in the European Union.

"Over the past half century, one of the most important developments in the study of the American Congress has been the incorporation and expansion of rational choice approaches and formal models which have improved the understanding of legislative policymaking, of internal congressional politics, and of external interactions between Congress and its broader environment. Although formal models have been developed to analyze various topics in congressional studies, they have been used inconsistently and have had varying impacts across substantive subfields. While the formal approaches have the ability to probe deeply into strategic decision-making, this capacity is limited when the formal modelers do not present their findings in an accessible way to a broad audience and when formalization is incompletely exercised. This article examines five tasks to overcome the limitations of formal approaches to the study of Congress. First, it defines what constitutes a complete formal model, hence forming the framework for understanding the possible contributions of formal approaches. Second, it surveys the examples of how formal models have been used to analyze the internal politics of Congress and the external relations of Congress with other institutions. Third, it presents the developments of formal models in these two areas to determine the lessons on how techniques of formal approaches can be employed to overcome limitations and roadblocks in the scholarly studies of Congress. Fourth, it discusses how these lessons can be applied to suggest paths forward in the conscientious debates regarding parties in Congress.

"Recent empirical work has brought a renewed attention to the effect congressional rules of procedure have on the size of winning coalitions. Specifically, scholars have posited that legislative success hinges on the support of legislators identified by institutionally defined decision rules. Under these theories, supermajority decision rules in the U.S. Senate lead to larger, more inclusive coalitions on final passage. In this article, I reevaluate these claims by controlling for changes in the legislative agenda and the roll-call voting record. I find that the aggregate size of winning coalitions is highly responsive to the underlying legislative agenda, the size of the Senate's majority party, and the manner in which researchers treat unrecorded votes. Further, my findings suggest that any connection between changes in the Senate's voting rules and the size of winning coalitions is spurious. ©2011, Midwest Political Science Association.",winning coalition formation in the u.s. senate: the effects of legislative decision rules and agenda change,2011,American Journal of Political Science,"Madonna, A.J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Is ethnic social diversity relevant to cross-national variation in economic development, or is the inclusion or exclusion of said groups in political decision-making the more salient factor? We argue that deleterious policy effects resulting in diminished economic growth are caused by exclusion of mobilized ethnic groups from the policy process and not just ethnic social diversity per se. Conversely, a positive impact of ethnicity as more groups are included in the policy process with increasing access to cabinet is due, first, to the fact that a population finding its preferences represented in the policy process likely supports implementation of resultant policy. Second, the policy quality likely improves with greater variety in input. Third, a greater number of included ethnic groups in cabinet increases the number of ethnic partisan veto players in the policy process - thereby generating increased policy stability in the long term. We test this idea first on long-run growth in democracy and, second, on annual indicators of growth. We find that increasing ethnic social fragmentation still negatively impacts on the economy. However, cabinet diversity offsets some of these negative effects as it improves growth of GDP per capita. © The Author(s) 2011.",ethnic inclusion and economic growth,2011,Party Politics,"Birnir, J.K., Waguespack, D.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"I analyse a dataset of news from The New York Times, from 1946 to 1997. Controlling for the activity of the incumbent president and the U.S. Congress across issues, I find that during a presidential campaign, The New York Times gives more emphasis to topics on which the Democratic party is perceived as more competent (civil rights, health care, labor and social welfare) when the incumbent president is a Republican. This is consistent with the hypothesis that The New York Times has a Democratic partisanship, with some ""anti-incumbent"" aspects, in that - during a presidential campaign - it gives more emphasis to issues over which the (Republican) incumbent is weak. To the extent that the interest of readers across issues is not systematically related with the political affiliation of the incumbent president and the election cycle, the observed changes in news coverage are consistent with The New York Times departing from demand-driven news coverage. In fact, I show that these findings are robust to controlling for Gallup data on the most important problem facing the country, which I use as a proxy for issue tastes of Times' readers.

"Although Chilean municipalities are not permitted to borrow, they do so through arrears and leasing contracts. A formal model of municipal indebtedness is estimated, based on a sample of 345 municipalities with yearly data from 2004 to 2007. Variables that are positively and significantly related to borrowing through arrears are: mayors closely tied to the ruling central government coalition; politically diverse municipal councils; years close to elections; and deeper municipal involvement in education. While leasing contracts appear to be insensitive to political factors, they are positively and significantly related to municipal staff managerial skills and municipal revenues per capita. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",theory and evidence of municipal borrowing in chile,2011,Public Choice,"Leonardo, E.L.S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper surveys recent literature, both theoretical and empirical, regarding political explanations for fiscal deficits. Political economy suggests conflicts of interest may lie behind the emergence of deficits: (1) Opportunistic politicians generate deficits to win elections, even in conflict with general welfare; (2) Conflicts of interests between politicians' partisan preferences create incentives for (at least some) incumbents to run deficits and (3) Conflicts of interest between different social groups or regions generate tensions in the allocation of government resources leading to overspending. This paper reviews these different strands of the literature. It also covers contributions that highlight the crucial role of budget institutions in determining the extent to which the political motivations to generate deficits are indeed translated into poor fiscal outcomes.

"The symbolic importance of Barack Obama’s election is without question. But beyond symbolism, does the election of African-American politicians matter? Grose argues that it does and presents a unified theory of representation. Electing African-American legislators yields more federal dollars and congressional attention directed toward African-American voters. However, race and affirmative action gerrymandering have no impact on public policy passed in Congress. Grose is the first to examine a natural experiment and exceptional moment in history in which black legislators - especially in the U.S. South - represented districts with a majority of white constituents. This is the first systematic examination of the effect of a legislator’s race above and beyond the effect of constituency racial characteristics. Grose offers policy prescriptions, including the suggestion that voting rights advocates, the courts, and redistricters draw ‘black decisive districts’, electorally competitive districts that are likely to elect African Americans. © Christian R.

Its scope is interdisciplinary, integrating insights from political science, economics, law, and history.

Unlike existing analytical studies of the frontier that emphasize one or two sectors, this book considers all major sectors, as well as the relationship between informal and formal property institutions, while also proposing a novel theory of emergence and change in property institutions that provides a framework to interpret the complicated history of land laws in the United States. © Ilia Murtazashvili, 2013.",the political economy of the american frontier,2011,The Political Economy of the American Frontier,"Murtazashvili, I.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"While political analysis has commonly focused on the distributive problem of who gets what, many of the hardest choices facing modern societies are dilemmas of timing. If governments want to reduce public debt, slow climate change, or shore up pension systems, they must typically inflict immediate pain on citizens for gains that will only arrive over the long run. In Governing for the Long Term, Alan M. Jacobs investigates the conditions under which elected governments invest in long-term social benefits at short-term social cost. Jacobs contends that, along the path to adoption, investment-oriented policies must surmount three distinct hurdles to future-oriented state action: a problem of electoral risk, rooted in the scarcity of voter attention; a problem of prediction, deriving from the complexity of long-term policy effects; and a problem of institutional capacity, arising from interest groups' preferences for distributive gains over intertemporal bargains. Testing this argument through a four-country historical analysis of pension policymaking, the book illuminates crucial differences between the causal logics of distributive and intertemporal politics and makes a case for bringing trade-offs over time to the center of the study of policymaking. © Alan M.

On the other hand, fiscal decentralization might ensure the fiscal stability of the public sector by constraining Leviathan governments. Since the impact of decentralized government on fiscal outcomes is therefore ambiguous from a theoretical perspective, we explore this question empirically with a panel of 17 OECD countries over the 1975-2001 period.

We empirically analyze the impact of such auditors on fiscal policy at the Swiss local level.

"This article discusses the insights that Elinor Ostrom's work on common-pool resources and governing the commons can provide for the literature on fiscal commons. Institutional approaches to public finance often employ the metaphor of 'budgetary commons'. Although intuitively appealing, the notion of budgetary commons faces the danger of becoming a catch-all term that is simply taken as a starting point for an inquiry, without scrutinising the fit between the metaphor and the actual setting. In addressing this shortcoming, the literature on budgetary commons can learn from Elinor Ostrom and the analytical approaches she has advocated in her research on natural commons. This article brings out insights from Ostrom's work that would be particularly useful for institutional analysis of budgeting. It shows that institutional approaches to public finance can draw on Ostrom's work with regard to the general approach for examining institutional configurations and their evolution over time, the analytical structures she uses for conceptualising the problems occurring on the commons, the desire to understand institutional complexity in real-life settings, and her scepticism of over-simplified models that are often used for describing and understanding the problems of common-pool resources. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",governing budgetary commons: what can we learn from elinor ostrom?,2010,European Journal of Law and Economics,"Raudla, R.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",340
"In addition to the known effects of government fractionalization, we find that larger deficits are associated with a reduced likelihood of budgetary reforms. In a war of attrition setting, larger deficits signify stronger entitlements on the budget, generating unwillingness to impose self-discipline. A sense of crisis emerges only when macroeconomic imbalances appear. However, while a crisis creates the opportunity for reform, policy credibility is important for effectively using that opportunity. We find that one way of establishing credibility is by undertaking measures in opposition to the government's known ideological position - these presumably signal motivation by broader social welfare considerations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",breaking the impediments to budgetary reforms: evidence from europe,2010,Economics and Politics,"Fabrizio, S., Mody, A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",341

"Commissions of inquiry play an important role in the aftermath of crisis, by serving as instruments of accountability and policy learning. Yet crises also involve a high-stake game of political survival, in which accountability and learning pose a serious threat to incumbent politicians.

Using data from the United Kingdom, this study develops and tests a choice model for this political decision.

"Empirical literature on the analysis of the efficiency of measures for reducing persistent government deficits has mainly focused on the direct explanation of deficit. By contrast, this paper aims at modeling government revenue and expenditure within a simultaneous framework and deriving the fiscal balance (surplus or deficit) equation as the difference between the two variables. This setting enables one to not only judge how relevant the explanatory variables are in explaining the fiscal balance but also understand their impact on revenue and/or expenditure. Our empirical results, obtained by using a panel data set on Swiss Cantons for the period 1980-2002, confirm the relevance of the approach followed here, by providing unambiguous evidence of a simultaneous relationship between revenue and expenditure. They also reveal strong dynamic components in revenue, expenditure, and fiscal balance. Among the significant determinants of public fiscal balance we not only find the usual business cycle elements, but also and more importantly institutional factors such as the number of administrative units, and the ease with which people can resort to political (direct democracy) instruments, such as public initiatives and referendum. © 2010 Public Financial Publications, Inc.",explaining fiscal balances with a simultaneous equation model of revenue and expenditure: a case study of swiss cantons using panel data,2010,Public Budgeting and Finance,"Krishnakumar, J., Martin, M.-J., Soguel, N.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"How does the electoral geography of legislative districts affect pork barreling? This article presents a formal model extending Mayhew's classic credit-claiming theory to account for the electoral geography of bicameralism. Under bicameralism, upper chamber (Senate) and lower chamber (Assembly) legislators who share overlapping constituencies must collaborate to bring home pork projects. Collaboration is easier between a Senator and an Assembly Member who share a large fraction of their constituents and thus have relatively aligned electoral incentives. But dividing a Senate district into a larger number of Assembly district fragments misaligns these electoral incentives for collaboration, thus reducing equilibrium pork spending. Hence, increased Senate district fragmentation causes a decrease in equilibrium spending. I exploit the 2002 New York Senate expansion as a natural experiment, examining how sudden changes in the geographic fragmentation of Senate districts account for differences in the distribution of pork earmarks immediately before and after the redrawing of district boundaries. ©2010, Midwest Political Science Association.",the effect of electoral geography on pork barreling in bicameral legislatures,2010,American Journal of Political Science,"Chen, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",350
"""Strong"" political parties within legislatures are one possible solution to the problem of inefficient universalism, a norm under which all legislators seek large projects for their districts that are paid for out of a common pool. We demonstrate that even if parties have no role in the legislature, their role in elections can be sufficient to reduce spending. If parties in the electorate are strong, then legislators will demand less distributive spending because of a decreased incentive to secure a "" personal vote"" via local projects. We estimate that spending in states with strong party organizations is at least 4% smaller than in states where parties are weak.

"External revenue in the form of foreign aid constitutes an important component of the government's budget constraint in many developing countries. We derive optimal public spending-and the resulting optimal deficit and debt-in an optimal control framework when the government seeks to maximize the utility of constituents in the presence of external revenue that cannot be influenced by the government directly but is contingent on public revenue and debt.

In this paper we use a simple bureaucracy model of fiscal illusion to analyse the impact of intergovernmental grants on the cost efficiency of local jurisdictions. We find that a higher degree of redistribution within a system of fiscal equalisation or an increase in the amount of grants received by a local jurisdiction leads to an extension of organisational slack or X-inefficiency in that jurisdiction. This theoretical prediction is tested by conducting an empirical analysis using a broad panel of German municipalities. The results of the empirical analysis are consistent with the theoretical findings and therefore support the existence of a negative incentive effect of intergovernmental grants on local authorities' cost efficiency. © 2010 Economic Society of Australia (Queensland) Inc.,the impact of intergovernmental grants on cost efficiency: theory and evidence from german municipalities,2010,Economic Analysis and Policy,"Kalb, A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",358
"Building on the literature on public finance, this article explores the consequences of political scale for government spending. The central argument is that the tendency for small political units to have big governments is not merely the result of economies of scale in the provision of public goods, but a reflection of the greater pressures for public spending faced by politicians in smaller and more homogeneous political units. The importance of such political pressures relative to other influences on spending is assessed on the basis of subnational data by comparing the relationship between size and spending under democracy and dictatorship. To the extent that government expansion is driven by citizen demands, the impact of size on spending may be expected to be more pronounced under democratic than authoritarian governance. Results from a time-series cross-sectional analysis of growth in government spending are consistent with this expectation. Government growth is shaped not only by the population size of political units but also by the interaction between regime and size. Analysis of spending patterns under democratic rule further indicates that size is an important determinant of spending even after controlling for variations in citizen preferences, political institutions, electoral competitiveness, and economic performance. The results have important theoretical implications for the study of fiscal policy and democratic governance around the world because they suggest that political scale conditions the linkages between citizens and the state, creating widely varying incentives for government growth across differently sized political units. © 2010, European Consortium for Political Research.

"Introduction The LAC region has historically been a fiscal basket case. Since the 1970s, debt crises, hyperinflations, and balance of payments crises have recurred, hampering growth prospects and affecting the welfare of low-income households the most. Furthermore, public spending and the tax system are inefficient and regressive, and fiscal policy is procyclical, augmenting the already high macroeconomic volatility. Although fiscal reforms in the 1990s combined with high growth and rising commodity prices significantly improved fiscal outcomes after 2004, it is not yet clear that a break with the past has occurred. High debt levels persist and, as I shall show in the next section, an important part of the recent increases in revenue are transitory, while increases in expenditures tend to be permanent. This implies that the structural fiscal balance paints a less rosy picture than current figures, and that a downturn in economic activity could lead to a new bout of fiscal solvency problems. In this chapter I suggest four reforms to improve fiscal outcomes in the region, and attempt a quantification of the potential impact of these reforms based on the recent literature.

"When considering the implications for policy outcomes of the dispersion of policymaking authority across multiple actors, recent veto-actor scholarship has emphasized its potential to privilege the status quo and thus retard policyadjustment rates. In similar contexts, however, others have stressed collectiveaction and common-pool issues that arise when multiple policymakers share authority over policies. Still others have highlighted bargaining and compromise in policymaking with multiple actors. This paper offers a synthetic discussion of these multifarious effects of the number and diversity of policymaking actors, thereby placing veto-actor considerations in broader theoretical context, and it offers an empirical approach to modeling these manifold effects of multiple policymakers distinctly and effectively. It then offers an initial exploration of this synthetic-theoretical and structured-empirical approach in a study of the evolution of fiscal policy in developed democracies since the 1950s and 1960s.",the multiple effects of multiple policymakers: veto actors bargaining in common pools,2010,Italian Political Science Review,"Franzese Jr., R.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",361
"In this controversial book, Keith Krehbiel investigates and casts doubt upon a view of Congress held by many academics, journalists, and members of the lay public: that Congress is organized primarily to facilitate logrolling or “gains from trade” between legislators. The author puts forward an alternative “informational” theory that, unlike previous formal theories, highlights institutional needs and individual incentives for acquiring policy expertise. Using games with incomplete information, Krehbiel derives a set of unique and testable predictions about the organization of legislatures -- including the composition of committees and the procedures under which legislation is considered. Krehbiel’s creative illustrations and nonmathematical presentation of formal theories make this book accessible to a diverse set of readers.

"One of the most vexing problems for governments is building controversial facilities that serve the needs of all citizens but have adverse consequences for host communities. Policymakers must decide not only where to locate often unwanted projects but also what methods to use when interacting with opposition groups. In Site Fights, Daniel P. Aldrich gathers quantitative evidence from close to five hundred municipalities across Japan to show that planners deliberately seek out acquiescent and unorganized communities for such facilities in order to minimize conflict. When protests arise over nuclear power plants, dams, and airports, agencies regularly rely on the coercive powers of the modern state, such as land expropriation and police repression. Only under pressure from civil society do policymakers move toward financial incentives and public relations campaigns. Through fieldwork and interviews with bureaucrats and activists, Aldrich illustrates these dynamics with case studies from Japan, France, and the United States. The incidents highlighted in Site Fights stress the importance of developing engaged civil society even in the absence of crisis, thereby making communities both less attractive to planners of controversial projects and more effective at resisting future threats. © 2008 by Cornell University.

"Abstract. Background. The Norwegian hospital reform of 2002 was an attempt to make restructuring of hospitals easier by removing politicians from the decision-making processes. To facilitate changes seen as necessary but politically difficult, the central state took over ownership of the hospitals and stripped the county politicians of what had been their main responsibility for decades. This meant that decisions regarding hospital structure and organization were now being taken by professional administrators and not by politically elected representatives. The question raised here is whether this has had any effect on the speed of restructuring of the hospital sector. Method. The empirical part is a case study of the restructuring process in Innlandet Hospital Trust (IHT), which was one of the largest enterprise established after the hospital reform and where the vision for restructuring was clearly set. Different sources of qualitative data are used in the analysis. These include interviews with key actors, observational data and document studies. Results. The analysis demonstrates how the new professional leaders at first acted in accordance with the intentions of the hospital reform, but soon chose to avoid the more ambitious plans for restructuring the hospital structure and in fact reintroduced local politics into the decision-making process. The analysis further illustrates how local networks and engagement of political representatives from all levels of government complicated the decision-making process surrounding local structural reforms. Local political representatives teamed up with other actors and created powerful networks. At the same time, national politicians had incentives to involve themselves in the processes as supporters of the status quo. Conclusion. Because of the incentives that faced political actors and the controversial nature of major hospital reforms, the removal of local politicians and the centralization of ownership did not necessarily facilitate reforms in the hospital structure. Keeping politics at an arm's length may simply be unrealistic and further complicate the politics of local hospital reforms. © 2009 Tjerbo; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",the politics of local hospital reform: a case study of hospital reorganization following the 2002 norwegian hospital reform,2009,BMC Health Services Research,"Tjerbo, T.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper develops an open-economy growth model to analyze the growth and welfare effects of the European Union's R&D policy. In the case of independent countries, each national government chooses the level of government-funded research non-cooperatively and fails to internalize the spillover effects across countries. Consequently, government-funded research is underprovided. In an economic union, the central government budget causes the common-pool problem and leads to an overprovision of government-funded research. Within this framework, we find that although an economic union dominates independent countries in economic growth, the welfare domination is ambiguous. In particular, there is a critical degree of cross-country spillover above (below) which an economic union dominates (is dominated by) independent countries in social welfare. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

"The law of 1/n (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen, Journal of Political Economy, 1981) posits a positive relationship between the size of an elected body and government spending because the taxpayers in each district bear only 1/nth of the total tax burden. Relying on variation in the number of seats in elective bodies, evidence supportive of the law of 1/n has been found at all levels of representative government. It is possible, however, that these findings suffer from endogeneity bias: Polities preferring larger government spending may also prefer to have more elected officials. In this paper, we propose an alternative test of the law of 1/n. In addition to postulating that larger elective bodies will have higher levels of government spending, the law of 1/n also implies that, ceteris paribus, there will be a negative relationship between locally targeted government spending and a jurisdiction's share of the taxation required to finance the spending. We test this prediction by examining the relationship between spatially targeted government spending and the tax burden across states. We find a negative relationship between local tax contributions to the common taxbase and locally targeted government spending for aggregate locally targeted spending and for six of eight subcategories. These findings are robust to the inclusion of other variables thought to influence the distribution of spending on parochial projects.",spatially targeted government spending and heterogeneous constituent cost shares,2009,Journal of Private Enterprise,"Bradbury, J.C., Frank Stephenson, E.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,367
"By examining party-switching decisions among members of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), this article shows how distributive policy programs exclusively available to the governing party attract incumbents to the party in power. In a stable electoral environment where the government party is likely to stay in power, legislators elected from infrastructure-poor constituencies are effectively tied to the party. However, when the party's electoral prospects are uncertain, legislators behave more sincerely and switch parties to match their policy preferences. It is also found that defectors elected from infrastructurepoor constituencies tended to return to the LDP once the party installed a stable surplus coalition.",infrastructure as the magnet of power: explaining why japanese legislators left and returned to the ldp,2009,Journal of East Asian Studies,"Saito, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The U.S. House of Representatives has been frozen at 435 members for almost a century, and in that time the nation's population has grown by more than 200 percent. With the number of citizens represented by each House member now dramatically larger, is a major consequence of this historical disparity a diminished quality of representation? Brian Frederick uses empirical data to scrutinize whether representation has been undermined by keeping a ceiling on the number of seats available in the House. He examines the influence of constituency size on several metrics of representation-including estimating the effects on electoral competition, policy responsiveness, and citizen contact with and approval of their representatives-and argues that now is the time for the House to be increased in order to better represent a rapidly growing country. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

"Do legislative constraints constrain or compel democratic executives' conflict behavior during periods of economic decline? Although institutional constraints are thought to reduce democratic executives' propensity to engage in interstate conflict, other research suggests that such constraints may provide incentives to engage in diversionary uses of force. Incorporating work from the comparative study of economic voting and cross-national research on the diversionary use of force, this article contends that government arrangements - coalition, minority, weak party cohesion - influence democratic conflict behavior by (1) shaping the extent to which the executive is held accountable for the economy and (2) determining the executive's capacity to address the economy with legislation. Specifically, the argument presented here suggests that governing parties in coalition governments share the blame for a poor economy, reducing the likelihood that the executive initiates disputes in response to the economy. Compared to single-party majority governments with high party discipline, executives presiding over minority governments, or whose parties are plagued by a lack of cohesion, are more likely to initiate disputes when faced with poor economic conditions, because these executives are likely to face resistance to remedial economic policy. Probit analyses of the interactive effects of government arrangements and economic performance on dispute initiation among industrialized democracies, 1950-97, support the argument. The article concludes with implications for research in comparative politics and international relations, including, for example, executive-legislative relations and strategic conflict avoidance. © The Author(s), 2009.","democracy and diversion: government arrangements, the economy, and dispute initiation",2009,Journal of Peace Research,"Brulé, D.J., Williams, L.K.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",372
"Although there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that unequal political representation in a legislature leads to an unequal distribution of funds, testing such theories empirically is challenging because it is difficult to separate the effects of representation from the effects of either population levels or changes. We leverage the natural experiment generated by infrequent and discrete census apportionment cycles to estimate the distributional effects of malapportionment in the U.S. House of Representatives. We find that changes in representation cause changes in the distribution of federal outlays to the states.

"This paper provides one of the first empirical analyses of the local voter initiative. Using a unique and comprehensive dataset from California, it analyzes determinants of local initiatives and effects of these measures on municipal finances. Results indicate that initiatives occur more frequently in large and diverse jurisdictions with more recent movers, voters unaffiliated with a major political party, and public employees. Effects of city size are partly offset by district- or ward-level elections. Contrary to previous research on statewide initiatives, this study detects a positive and weakly significant relationship between local initiative use and own-source revenues per capita and no association between initiatives and the proportion of funds raised from fees. These divergent findings may reflect distinctive features of the local context, including greater latitude for political bargaining and the centrality of land use, as well as potential constraining effects of statewide initiatives in California. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",bargaining in the shadow of the ballot box: causes and consequences of local voter initiatives,2009,Public Choice,"Gordon, T.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We develop a model of electoral competition in which two parties compete for votes amongst three groups of voters. Each party first internally selects one of two candidates to run in a general election. Candidates within a party share a fixed ideological platform and can promise a distribution of a unit of public spending across groups. Without primary elections, the selection process is random. With primary elections, an ideologically friendly subset of the voters strategically chooses the candidate. In the basic model, primary elections cause politicians to cater to extreme groups rather than a moderate group with many swing voters. The amount promised to extreme groups is decreasing in the ideological polarization of those groups, while each party's probability of victory is increasing in the size and extremity of its favored group. We also find that an incumbency advantage reduces the amount promised to extremists, and therefore benefits moderates. © 2009 Copyright Southern Political Science Association.",distributive politics with primaries,2009,Journal of Politics,"Hirano, S., Snyder Jr., J.M., Ting, M.M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",375

"There are more than 500,000 elected local government officials in the United States. The most electorally dense county has more than 20 times the average number of elected officials per capita. This paper offers the first systematic investigation of the link between electoral density and fiscal outcomes. Electoral density presents a tradeoff between accountability and monitoring costs. Increasing the number of specialized elected offices promotes issue unbundling, reducing slack between citizen preferences and government policy; but the costs of monitoring a larger number of officials may offset these benefits, producing greater latitude for politicians to pursue their own goals at the expense of citizen interests. We predict diminishing returns to electoral density and a U-shaped relationship between the number of elected local officials and government fidelity to citizen preferences. We find that public sector size decreases with electoral density up to a point, beyond which budgets grow as more officials are added. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

"Scholars have focused attention toward congressional influence over distributive grant allocations, but they have less frequently examined the extent to which administrative agencies play a role in that process. We present a new theory of ideology-contingent executive decision making within a multiple-principals framework to explain the geographic distribution of policy benefits. Our theory is novel in that it locates interbranch ideological conflict and confluence at the center of bureaus allocational strategies. Discretionary Department of Labor (DOL) grants and Department of Defense (DOD) contracts from 1991 to 2002 are examined to provide evidence that agencies deliver more grants to senators with proximate ideologies. To measure bureaucratic ideology, we generate comparable ideology estimates for cabinet secretaries, presidents, and members of the U.S. Senate via an item-response model. Our findings suggest that ideological congruence between senators and DOL or DOD is associated with significantly larger amounts of grants or contracts, respectively.

"The Western world exhibited a significant trend towards larger local governments in the twentieth century, which was driven to a large extent by boundary reforms. Boundary reforms can provide economic benefits, but may also give rise to costs driven by opportunistic political behavior. This study uses a Swedish compulsory reform to test for such behavior. The reform gives a local government the incentive to accumulate debt before a merger takes place, since the taxpayers in the new locality will share the cost. The strength of the incentive to free ride is determined by the population size of the initial locality relative to that of the new locality.

"The Political Economy of Government Auditing addresses the elusive quest for greater transparency and accountability in the management of public finances in emerging economies; and, more specifically, it examines the contribution of autonomous audit agencies (AAAs) to the fight against corruption and waste. Whilst the role of audit agencies in curbing corruption is increasingly acknowledged, there exists little comparative work on their institutional effectiveness. Addressing the performance of AAAs in emerging economies, Carlos Santiso pursues a political economy perspective that addresses the context in which audit agencies are embedded, and the governance factors that make them work or fail. Here, the cases of Argentina, Brazil and Chile are examined, as they illustrate the three - parliamentary, court and independent - models of AAAs in modern states, and their three distinct trajectories of reform, or lack of reform. Beyond Latin America, considerations on the reform of government auditing in other countries, developed and developing are also taken up as, it is argued, while institutional arrangements for government auditing matter, political factors ultimately determine the effectiveness of AAAs. Reforming AAAs, it is concluded, must consider the trajectory of state building, the role of law in public administration and the quality of governance. An important contribution to the comparative study of governance institutions, and especially those tasked with overseeing the budget and curbing corruption, The Political Economy of Government Auditing will be of interest to scholars and students of comparative politics, development studies, administrative law, and public finance; as well as to development practitioners and policy-makers in developing countries, donor governments and international institutions. © 2009 Carlos Santiso.

"In most local developing settings, the political leader and the municipal manager are embodied in the same figure, the directly elected mayor. This research explores the impact of mayoral quality on local public finances in a developing country. Mayoral quality is operationalized as educational background and job-related expertise to analyze its impact on two local financial indicators: property tax collection and social spending per capita. The mayoral quality thesis is tested across 40 Colombian municipalities over five years (2000-2004). After considering other political, economic, and external influences, the findings reveal that mayoral quality is associated with greater property tax collection and more social spending per capita. This positive influence, however, decreases under external constraints - such as presence of illegal armed groups. This study demonstrates how much influence the mayor can have when circumstances permit. The findings point to the significance of electing qualified mayors, as decentralization may not directly improve subnational finance.

While FGFF emphasizes correcting vertical and horizontal equity, SGFF emphasizes the importance of fiscal incentives for producing local economic prosperity. SGFF extends FGFF approaches by showing how non-linear transfer systems can produce both equalization and high marginal fiscal incentives to produce local economic growth.

The value of landings and the private costs of the harvest over a cycle (1988-1994) are calculated. On average, fishers extracted rents of C$34.7 million (in constant 1995 Canadian dollars) annually. The public costs of enhancing the resource and organizing and policing the harvest are estimated. When these costs are included in the calculation, net benefits drop to an average of negative C$55.6 million annually. This translates into a net present value (NPV) of the salmon fishery of negative C$784 million. The effects on NPVofboth modest policy changes implemented in 1996-1997 and of a more dramatic but credible fleet rationalization program are provided. The results indicate that further policy change is called for. More generally, the study shows that policy reform that would significantly benefit both the private sector (through reduced rent dissipation) and the public sector (through reduced government expenditures) can be surprisingly difficult. © 2008 the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",net loss: a cost-benefit analysis of the canadian pacific salmon fishery,2009,Cost-Benefit Analysis and Public Policy,"Schwindt, R., Vining, A., Globerman, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article characterizes the perceptions of government bureaucrats about cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The observations arise after working with government officials on various projects and leading many executive seminars for government employees over the last decade on the principles and practice of CBA. Government employees tend to adopt one of three conceptual lenses: Guardians, Spenders, and Analysts. These perspectives differ sharply from one another, resulting in completely different meanings to the words benefits and costs. The orientation of Guardians is to ""revenue-expenditure"" analysis, white Spenders are oriented to ""constituency-support"" analysis. Analysts are oriented to standard CBA. The differences in perspectives are illustrated using an ex ante CBA of a proposed toll highway project. © 2008 the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",costs and benefits through bureaucratic lenses: example of a highway project,2009,Cost-Benefit Analysis and Public Policy,"Boardman, A., Vining, A., Waters, W.G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Politicians bias public policies to favor particular election districts. According to the traditional common pool model, districts facing low tax shares should receive relatively large government projects. We suggest a swing-voter model where the number of voters on the ideological cut point, lack of party identification and number of district representatives per voter determine project sizes. We analyze the allocation of state road investments in Norway from 1973-1997 exploiting unique data on characteristics of voters, legislative representation and tax prices in 19 election districts. Geographical representation to parliament is biased, mostly due to an ancient constitution. Shares of swing voters and legislative over-representation lead to higher levels of road investments, while high levels of party identification reduce investments. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",geographical redistribution with disproportional representation: a politico-economic model of norwegian road projects,2009,Public Choice,"Helland, L., Sørensen, R.J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",389

Our empirical analysis indicates that the Senate electoral cycle induces a back-loading of benefits to the end of senatorial terms, but that the House blunts this tendency with countercyclical appropriations.

"Previous scholarship has investigated why legislatures sometimes choose to delegate policy choice to executive agencies, but there is little research on the consequences of the choice to delegate or not. Using a multiple principal-agent framework, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding the impact of legislative delegation and agency discretion on the work of U.S. government employees. Findings suggest that delegation directly reduces employee discretion only in client service agencies; its direct effects on employee productivity are more evident but varied. Legislative delegation is also associated with more executive political appointees, whose presence reduces both employee discretion and productivity. Whether employees with more discretion are more productive than those with less depends on their commitment to the job: employees who like their work more than their pay use their discretion to enhance productivity, while employees who like their pay more than their work use their discretion to reduce productivity.",controlling federal agencies: the contingent impact of external controls on worker discretion and productivity,2009,International Public Management Journal,"Langbein, L.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This book presents a theoretical framework to discuss how governments coordinate budgeting decisions. There are two modes of fiscal governance conducive to greater fiscal discipline, a mode of delegation and a mode of contracts. These modes contrast with a fiefdom form of governance, in which the decision-making process is decentralized. An important insight is that the effectiveness of a given form of fiscal governance depends crucially upon the underlying political system. Delegation functions well when there few, or no, ideological differences among government parties, whereas contracts are effective when there are many such differences. Based on original research, the book classifies European Union countries from 1985 to 2004. Empirically, delegation and contract states perform better than fiefdom states if they match the underlying political system. Additional chapters consider why countries have the fiscal institutions that they do, fiscal governance in Central and Eastern Europe, and the role of such institutions in the European Union. © Mark Hallerberg, Rolf Rainer Strauch, Jürgen von Hagen 2009.",fiscal governance in europe,2009,Fiscal Governance In Europe,"Hallerberg, M., Strauch, R.R., Von Hagen, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Imperfect Union offers the first political theory of special purpose jurisdictions, which constitute the most common form of local government in the United States today. Collectively, special purpose governments have more civilian employees than the federal government and spend more than all city governments combined. The proliferation of special purpose jurisdictions has fundamentally altered the nature of representation and taxation in local government. Citizens today are commonly represented by dozens - in some cases hundreds - of local officials in multiple layers of government. As a result, political participation in local elections is low and special interest groups associated with each function exert disproportionate influence. With multiple special-interest governments tapping the same tax base, the local tax base takes on the character of a common-pool resource, leading to familiar problems of overexploitation. Strong political parties can often mitigate the common-pool problem by informally coordinating the policies of multiple overlapping governments. © Christopher R.

"Agricultural Policy has been a core element of the European Economic Community since its early beginnings (Tracy 1989, 1997). The assessment of the role for the European Union (EU) and the Member States in agricultural policy in this chapter is based on the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Ederveen et al. (2008). The Treaty of the European Community (1997) states that ""the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity"" only for ""areas which do not fall within its [the Community's] exclusive competence"" (Art. 5, par. 2). This chapter, however, goes beyond this definition and reviews the role of the EU and the Member States in agricultural policy design and funding independently from the criterion of whether they fall under exclusive responsibility of the EU, such as large parts of agricultural policy in the EU.

"There is a growing body of literature on the commitment problem of interregional transfers. The problem occurs because of an ex post bailout by a central government leading to ex ante adverse incentive consequences for a local government. However, different models have yielded different economic consequences. The local government may be too large, overspending and/or overborrowing, or it may be too small, raising less of its own revenue. In the presence of interregional spillovers, the equilibrium may yield a Pareto-efficient outcome. The present paper aims to synthesize these models, developing a simple decentralized leadership model. A critical question concerns what decision is made ex ante by the local government-namely public expenditure or tax collection-with the remaining policy instrument being residual adjusted by ex post transfers. We discuss how different scenarios affect the equilibrium outcome. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Conversely, the execution stage is characterized by an excess of centralization. Lack of transparency is a direct consequence of this state of affairs.

"What explains variations in electoral volatility? The authors argue that fiscal space-availability of financial resources to enact policy initiatives and provide public programs-possessed by governments can explain the level of electoral volatility. Where governments have fiscal space, citizens reward incumbent parties with their continued support. But when fiscal space is constrained, the incumbent government's ability to provide state resources is drastically reduced. Citizens are therefore less likely to reward the party at the polls and are available to opposition politicians and alternative appeals. Vote-switching ensues, and the incumbent government is voted out of the office. The authors test this argument and others in the existing literature on electoral returns from state assembly elections across 15 major Indian states from 1967 to 2004.

"Without pressure from a small but influential group of London financiers, Confederation would not have occurred in 1867, if at all. These financiers supported the unification of the British North American colonies because they believed it would rescue their under-performing investments and keep British North America within the British Empire. Andrew Smith discusses the role of British investors in Canadian Confederation, covering the period from the construction of the Grand Trunk Railroad in the 1850s to Canada's purchase of Rupert's Land in 1869-70. He describes how some investors lobbied the British government for the policies that made Confederation possible, working closely with the Fathers of Confederation, many of whom were participants in the same trans-Atlantic crony-capitalist system. British factory owners with classical liberal beliefs, however, disliked Confederation because they believed it would delay the political independence of the North American colonies, something they saw as beneficial.

"In this paper we analyze the interaction of income and preference heterogeneity in a political economy framework. We ask whether the presence of preference heterogeneity (arising, for example, from different ethnic groups or geographic locations) affects the ability of the poor to extract resources from the rich. We study the equilibrium of a game in which coalitions of individuals form parties, parties propose platforms, and all individuals vote, with the winning policy chosen by plurality. Political parties are restricted to offering platforms that are credible (in that they belong to the Pareto set of their members). The platforms specify the values of two policy tools: a general redistributive tax which is lump-sum rebated (or used to fund a general public good) and a series of taxes whose revenue is used to fund specific (targeted) goods tailored to particular preferences or localities. Our analysis demonstrates that taste conflict first dilutes but later reinforces class interests. When the degree of taste diversity is low, the equilibrium policy is characterized by some amount of general income redistribution and some targeted transfers. As taste diversity increases in society, the set of equilibrium policies becomes more and more tilted towards special interest groups and against general redistribution. As diversity increases further, however, the only policy that can emerge supports exclusively general redistribution. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"During the twentieth century, the United States shifted from embracing protectionism to being an advocate for global free trade. Scholarly debate has focused on whether this shift was solely because of changes in preferences or if changes to institutions also played a role. Relying upon access point theory, this article argues that an institutional change, delegation to the President, led to endogenous changes in preferences. Delegation makes it harder for interest groups to gain access to policy makers, which should raise the costs of all lobbying. As protectionists dominate lobbying due to their collective action advantage, they will be disproportionately hurt. Thus, delegation should lead to less lobbying and lower tariff rates.

"Several authors have argued that a centralization of fiscal powers in a federation is less likely to occur if citizens have to approve a change in the assignments of responsibilities by a popular referendum. This outcome may be due to the fact that logrolling is more difficult under direct than under representative democracy. It may also be caused by citizens' fear that a centralization of fiscal authority facilitates the extraction of rents by the government or the legislature. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that centralization is less likely under referendum decision-making in the unique institutional setting of Switzerland.

The relationship between efficiency and legislature size is often referred to as the ""law of 1/n""(Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). We demonstrate that the ""law of 1/n"" result with respect to project sizes and total spending is dependent on several factors, including the type of good being provided, the costs of raising revenue, and whether the local government has to share in the project's cost with the central government. In general, the ""law of 1/n"" need not hold for total government spending, and in fact a ""reverse law of 1/n"" often holds. In light of our theoretical findings, we reassess the empirical literature on this topic.

"While a large literature exists on the siting of controversial facilities, few theories about spatial location have been tested on large samples. Using a new dataset from Japan, this paper demonstrates that state agencies choose localities judged weakest in local civil society as host communities for controversial projects. In some cases, powerful politicians deliberately seek to have facilities such as nuclear power plants, dams and airports placed in their home constituency. This paper then explores new territory: how demographic, political and civil society factors impact the outcomes of siting attempts. It finds that the strength of local civil society impacts the probability that a proposed project will come to fruition; the greater the concentration of local civil society, the less likely state-planned projects will be completed. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.","location, location, location: selecting sites for controversial facilities",2008,Singapore Economic Review,"Aldrich, D.P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article analyzes the political determinants of the distribution of infrastructure expenditures by the Italian government to the country's 92 provinces between 1953 and 1994. Extending implications of theories of legislative behavior to the context of open-list proportional representation, we examine whether individually powerful legislators and ruling parties direct spending to core or marginal electoral districts and whether opposition parties share resources via a norm of universalism. We show that when districts elect politically more powerful deputies from the governing parties, they receive more investments. We interpret this as indicating that legislators with political resources reward their core voters by investing in public works in their districts. The governing parties, by contrast, are not able to discipline their own members of parliament sufficiently to target the parties' areas of core electoral strength. Finally, we find no evidence that a norm of universalism operates to steer resources to areas when the main opposition party gains more votes. © 2008, Midwest Political Science Association.","pork-barrel politics in postwar italy, 1953-94",2008,American Journal of Political Science,"Golden, M.A., Picci, L.",Scopus,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,421
"Numerical fiscal rules implemented at the national level in member countries of the European Union offer useful information on possible reasons for the growing reliance on such rules, and on their implication for fiscal policy. Our analysis of a survey-based dataset suggests that both the introduction of the EU fiscal framework and country-specific fiscal governance features played a role in triggering introduction of numerical fiscal rules, and that the impact of rules is statistically significant, robust, and quantitatively important. Outcomes and rules may be jointly determined by unobserved political factors, but the evidence suggests that causality runs from rules to fiscal behaviour, and that rules specifically designed to prevent conflicts with the stabilization function of fiscal policy are indeed associated with less pro-cyclical policies. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2008.",tied to the mast? national fiscal rules in the european union,2008,Economic Policy,"Debrun, X., Moulin, L., Turrini, A., Ayuso-i-Casals, J., Kumar, M.S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article examines the political and economic determinants of the relative duration of fiscal consolidations in Europe. The study focuses on the fifteen Member States that formed the EU between 1960 and 2004, and applies survival analysis techniques to their fiscal data. We find evidence that the probability of ending a period of fiscal consolidation depends on the debt level, the magnitude of the adjustment, the relative contribution of spending cuts, and the degree of cabinet fragmentation. Most importantly we also find that under a stricter definition of fiscal consolidation, political variables, such as coalition size and election year, gain importance with respect to economic variables as predictors of the probability of ending an episode of fiscal consolidation. This relative importance of political variables weakened in the run-up to EMU, probably because countries had to consolidate irrespective of their political constraints. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, BV.",what makes fiscal consolidations last? a survival analysis of budget cuts in europe (1960-2004),2008,Public Choice,"Illera, R.M., Mulas-Granados, C.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper presents a political economy theory of fiscal policy. Policy choices are made by a legislature that can raise revenues via an income tax and by borrowing. Revenues can be used to finance a public good, whose value is stochastic, and pork-barrel spending. Policymaking cycles between a ""business-as-usual"" regime in which legislators bargain over pork, and a ""responsible policymaking"" regime in which policies maximize the collective good. Transitions between regimes are brought about by shocks in the value of the public good.

"Studies of EU trade policy-making often suggest that delegation of trade authority from the national to the European level strengthened the autonomy of public actors in formulating trade policies. Little empirical research, however, has been undertaken to corroborate this contention. To improve on this situation, I carry out two case studies of the EU's participation in the multilateral trade negotiations known as the Kennedy Round (1964-67) and the Doha Development Agenda (2001 onwards). The analysis reveals that in both cases the EU's negotiating position was largely in line with the demands voiced by economic interests. Although this finding is no proof of economic interests actually determining EU trade policies, it casts some doubt on the autonomy thesis.

"The 1999-2006 versions of the Italian Domestic Stability Pact had many shortcomings and a modest impact with respect to the aim of aligning the fiscal behaviour of sub-national government units with the national commitments under the European Stability and Growth Pact. The Domestic Pact was revised in 2007 and 2008 to tighten the monitoring and sanctions framework and prevent some inefficient behaviour. However, some undesirable features still mar the new regime: no coordination exists between the Domestic Pact and the debt and tax constraints applied to local governments; a clear definition of the contribution of sub-national governments to aggregate compliance with the external rule is still lacking; flexibility has been introduced by means of an artificial reference budget balance; side effects on resource redistribution are ignored; and monitoring and sanctioning remain weak. Remedies for the above shortcomings can possibly be found in the domestic pacts of the other EMU countries. Most of all, the Domestic Pact should be adjusted to the specific characteristics of fiscal decentralization in Italy, where a large fiscal gap exists, revenue autonomy is constrained and a large share of the responsibility for spending is rigid and politically sensitive.",the domestic stability pact: assessment of the italian experience and comparison with the other emu countries,2008,Review of Economic Conditions in Italy,"Gastaldi, F., Giuriato, L.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Anecdotal evidence suggests that U.S. state politicians manipulate rainy day funds for political purposes, but such claims remain untested in the literature. This article finds that lawmakers withdraw nearly three times more funds in response to a deficit shock of a given size if it occurs in an election year rather than in a non-election year; this occurs despite the fact that the magnitude of shocks does not vary over the electoral cycle. This effect is stronger when incumbents are eligible for re-election than when they are term-limited.

"This article examines party discipline and party cohesion or defection, offering as an illustration the rebellion over postal privatization in 2005 by members of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). It explores the importance of party rules – especially the seniority rule and policy specialization for district rewards – as intervening variables between election rules and party defection in a decentralized and diverse party. It is argued that in such cases, party rules like seniority can help prevent defection. When these rules are changed, as in the postal case of 2005, defection is more probable, but it is found that the relationship between defection and seniority is likely to be curvilinear, and also that the curvilinearity is conditional upon each legislator's having different incentives for vote, policy and office. © 2008, Cambridge University Press.

"Recent movements to deprofessionalize American state legislatures have been driven partly by the notion that professional legislators spend more than their citizen counterparts. This article explores the relationship between legislative professionalism and government spending, a connection complicated by the possibility that legislators in high-spending states may choose professional institutions to handle their responsibilities more effectively. I employed propensity score matching, an increasingly used technique of causal inference, to disentangle the relationship. Contrary to previous academic work and popular notions, I found that professional legislatures do not spend significantly more than part-time bodies do, if one accounts for the fact that legislatures in high-spending states have a greater need to be professionalized and therefore select those structural frameworks. These findings have important implications for the study of the effects of legislative institutions on public policies more generally and attest to the utility of recently developed techniques of causal inference to disentangle these relationships.",disentangling the relationship between legislative professionalism and government spending,2008,Legislative Studies Quarterly,"Malhotra, N.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Unlike the federal Constitution, virtually all state constitutions give detailed attention to questions of public finance. State constitutions limit spending, mandate certain types of spending, constrain taxation and debt, and require special procedures for enacting a budget. One consequence of the constitutionalization of the state fisc is its judicialization, as these measures trigger litigation. Fiscal and political conflicts turn into legal disputes, with courts joining governors and legislatures in shaping state budgets and making state fiscal policy. This chapter provides an early-21st-century snapshot of the state constitutional law of state finance through a survey of six recent state supreme court decisions – all handed down since the turn of the millennium – interpreting key provisions of their states' fiscal constitutions. Part II examines three cases concerning provisions intended to constrain the state fisc: a legislative supermajority vote for tax increases, a voter-approval requirement for new debt, and a balanced-budget requirement. In two cases, courts delivered decisions that aided the more political branches of government, but were sharply at variance with the constitutional text. In the third, the court followed the constitutional text and, in so doing, challenged a state's fiscal arrangements. Part III focuses on three cases dealing with the budgetary process: the executive budget, limits on the content of appropriations bills, and the item veto. These involved governor–legislature conflicts, debates over the programmatic reach of the special budgetary procedures, and questions about the scope of judicial intervention in these political–fiscal–constitutional matters. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and 2009.","courts, constitutions, and public finance: some recent experiences from the states",2008,Fiscal Challenges: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Budget Policy,"Briffault, R.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",433
"The Robust Federation offers a comprehensive approach to the study of federalism. Jenna Bednar demonstrates how complementary institutions maintain and adjust the distribution of authority between national and state governments. These authority boundaries matter - for defense, economic growth, and adequate political representation - and must be defended from opportunistic transgression. From Montesquieu to Madison, the legacy of early institutional analysis focuses attention on the value of competition between institutions, such as the policy moderation produced through separated powers. Bednar offers a reciprocal theory: in an effective constitutional system, institutions complement one another; each makes the others more powerful. Diverse but complementary safeguards - including the courts, political parties, and the people - cover different transgressions, punish to different extents, and fail under different circumstances. The analysis moves beyond equilibrium conceptions and explains how the rules that allocate authority are not fixed but shift gradually.

"This book explains how postwar Japan managed to achieve a highly egalitarian form of capitalism despite meager social spending. Estevez-Abe develops an institutional, rational-choice model to solve this puzzle. She shows how Japan's electoral system generated incentives that led political actors to protect various groups that lost out in market competition. She explains how Japan's postwar welfare state relied upon various alternatives to orthodox social spending programs. The initial postwar success of Japan's political economy has given way to periods of crisis and reform. This book follows this story up to the present day. Estevez-Abe shows how the current electoral system renders obsolete the old form of social protection. She argues that institutionally Japan now resembles Britain and predicts that Japan's welfare system will also come to resemble Britain's.

"Social security institutions have been among the most stable post-war social programs around the world. Increasingly, however, these institutions have undergone profound transformation from public risk-pooling systems to individual market-based designs. Why has this ‘privatization’ occurred? Why do some governments enact more radical pension privatizations than others? This book provides a theoretical and empirical account of when and to what degree governments privatize national old-age pension systems. Quantitative cross-national analysis simulates the degree of pension privatization around the world and tests competing hypotheses to explain reform outcomes. In addition, comparative analysis of pension reforms in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay evaluate a causal theory of institutional change. The central argument is that pension privatization emerges from political conflict, rather than from exogenous pressures. The argument is developed around three dimensions: the double bind of globalization, contingent path-dependent processes, and the legislative politics of loss imposition. © Sarah M.

"Normative theories of fiscal federalism postulate that intergovernmental transfers should be determined by equity and efficiency considerations, to support local governments in providing differentiated public goods to heterogeneous populations, while ensuring an even distribution of basic services across all regions (Musgrave, 1959, 1983; Oates, 1972; Gramlich, 1977). However, a recent surge of empirical evidence shows that the distribution of transfers across local jurisdictions, and what local governments do with these transfers is heavily influenced by political incentives facing both national and local policy-makers. Although the notion that intergovernmental transfers, like most other public policy issues, are influenced by and interact with political institutions and processes, is far from earth-shattering, until recently there had been little attempt to internalize the political implications when analyzing the role of transfers in equalizing access to basic services for all citizens. However, the new evidence shows that politics has such substantial impact on both the distribution and use of resources for local service delivery that it cannot be avoided nor side-stepped when developing intergovernmental fiscal policies for equalization. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",the political economy of equalization transfers,2007,Fiscal Equalization: Challenges in the Design of Intergovernmental Transfers,"Khemani, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In this paper I challenge the proposition that the golden rule of public sector borrowing is consistent with the principle of intertemporal allocative efficiency, in the sense that growth-enhancing public investment justifies a structural public deficit. I demonstrate that in the long run the social opportunity cost of debt-financed public investment exceeds the social opportunity cost of tax financed public investments. This result holds if the social rate of time preference is lower than the interest rate on government borrowing. Thus a benevolent government would use taxes to finance public investment. In the short run, debt financing is justified if public investment has a considerable growth effect on private consumption.

"In the 1980s scholars began applying Positive Political Theory (PPT) to study public law. This chapter summarizes that body of research and its relationship to other schools of legal thought. Like Law and Economics, PPT of Law uses sequential game theory to examine how rules and procedures shape policy and evaluates these outcomes from the perspective of economic efficiency. Like the Legal Process School in traditional legal scholarship, PPT of Law focuses on how the structure and process of legislative, bureaucratic and judicial decision-making influences the law and evaluates these procedures using the principle of democratic legitimacy; however, rather than using procedural norms derived from moral and political philosophy to evaluate procedures, PPT of Law conceptualizes the decision-making procedures of government as rationally designed by elected officials to shape the policies arising from decisions by executive agencies, the courts, and future elected officials.

"Previous institutional explanations of trade policy have focused on the role of proportional representation on the promotion of free trade. This explanation generates numerous unsolved anomalies and provides limited guidance in explaining the difference between proportional representation countries and between majoritarian countries as well as within-country variation in trade policy. This article introduces a more general institutional theory that argues that the number of access points provided by institutions is the crucial institutional feature, as increasing the number of access points makes lobbying less costly, which benefits protectionists. From this, I hypothesize that the number of parties in government, the number of electoral districts, the nature of the vote, and other such institutions affect the level of protection and that, once these factors are controlled for, proportional representation has no impact on trade policy.

Specifically, we argue that the level of political fragmentation of the government affects both the need for and possibility to engage in opportunistic policy cycles.

"This paper develops an infinite horizon model of public spending and taxation in which policy decisions are determined by legislative bargaining. The policy space incorporates both productive and distributive public spending and distortionary taxation. The productive spending is investing in a public good that benefits all citizens (e.g., national defense) and the distributive spending is district-specific transfers (e.g., pork-barrel spending). Investment in the public good creates a dynamic linkage across policymaking periods. The analysis explores the dynamics of legislative policy choices, focusing on the efficiency of the steady-state level of taxation and allocation of spending.",inefficiency in legislative policymaking: a dynamic analysis,2007,American Economic Review,"Battaglini, M., Coate, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The obligation to introduce the euro is widely assumed to provide incentives for fiscal consolidation in the new member states of the European Union. Without questioning the general validity of this thesis this article calls attention to the potential for an opposite effect and the possibility of exacerbating rather than reducing the deficit bias in these countries. The argument proceeds in three steps. First, it shows that, given a weaker institutional environment in emerging economies, the new member states of the EU are particularly prone to deficit bias. Second, the incentives from the EMU are analysed and the potential moral hazard problem is identified for the current members as well as the candidate states. Third, a closer examination of Hungarian fiscal policy developments between 2002 and 2005 illustrates how weak institutions and strong market confidence can result in excessive deficits. The main implication of the article is that without complementing the EMU fiscal framework with mandatory procedural rules at the national level the deficit bias is unlikely to be eliminated in the new member states, which could result in considerable imbalances after these countries join the euro zone.",deficit bias and moral hazard on the road to the emu: the political dimension of fiscal policy in hungary,2007,Post-Communist Economies,"Gyorffy, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"One area of fiscal policy in which several countries have delegated responsibility to an independent agency is the distribution of national resource transfers across regional and local governments. Such delegation is expected to promote equity and efficiency, and mitigate distortions created by political incentives. This paper tests whether delegation to an independent agency indeed makes a difference by contrasting the impact of partisan politics on two types of fiscal transfers to states in the Indian federation over a period of time, 1972-1995. The pattern of evidence shows that, while the transfers that are determined by the central political executive are indeed distributed to favor particular states that are politically important for the central ruling party, the transfers that are delegated to an independent agency serve to constrain such partisan impact. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper empirically analyzes whether government size is conducive or detrimental to life satisfaction in a cross-section of 74 countries. We thus provide a test of the longstanding dispute between standard neoclassical economic theory and public choice theory. According to the neoclassical view, governments play unambiguously positive roles for individuals' quality of life, while the theory of public choice has been developed to understand why governments often choose excessive involvement in - and regulation of - the economy, thereby harming their citizens' quality of life. Our results show that life satisfaction decreases with higher government consumption. For low, middle income, and male people, this result is stronger when the government is leftwing, while government consumption appears to be less harmful for women when the government is perceived to be effective. Government capital formation and social spending have no significant impact on life satisfaction. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.",the bigger the better? evidence of the effect of government size on life satisfaction around the world,2007,Public Choice,"Bjørnskov, C., Dreher, A., Fischer, J.A.V.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The literature on fiscal institutions argues that there is a pro-spending bias in legislative budgeting, which can be mitigated by institutional arrangements. In the mid-1990s Sweden carried out reforms to the budget process that fundamentally restructured parliamentary decision-making, including the voting process and the role of different committees. This paper assesses the impact of these reforms on legislative budgeting. It concludes that the new process helps to safeguard fiscal discipline, but also cautions against a simplistic interpretation of the fiscal institutionalist literature that treats institutional arrangements as exogenous. The constraints of the revised legislative process are essentially self-imposed, which in the final analysis makes it difficult to argue that the Swedish Parliament has lost budgetary control. Moreover, separate reforms of external audit and improvements in the provision of performance information provide an opportunity to strengthen accountability for results. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",budget reform and legislative control in sweden,2007,Journal of European Public Policy,"Wehner, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",454

"This paper studies the role of district magnitude and bargaining within legislature of parliamentary systems in determining the political success of agriculture in attracting government transfers. The model is based on a probabilistic voting environment where rural districts are less ideologically committed than urban districts. As a consequence, rural districts are pivotal in determining the coalition that obtains a majority, whereas urban districts are pivotal within the majority itself. In bargaining at the legislature, this generates a conflict between the prime minister, who will tend to favor rural districts, and its parliamentary majority, that will be dominated by urban concerns. As district size grows and the electoral system converges to a pure proportional system, both of these biases are attenuated. Overall, a non-linear relationship between district size and agricultural subsidies follows. Empirical results from CEE-countries support our theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","electoral systems, postelection bargaining and special interest politics in parliamentary systems: the case of agricultural protection",2007,International Symposia in Economic Theory and Econometrics,"Henning, C.H.C.A., Struve, C.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Since the days of Montesquieu and Jefferson, political decentralization has been seen as a force for better government and economic performance. It is thought to bring government 'closer to the people', nurture civic virtue, protect liberty, exploit local information, stimulate policy innovation, and alleviate ethnic tensions. Inspired by such arguments, and generously funded by the major development agencies, countries across the globe have been racing to devolve power to local governments. This book re-examines the arguments that underlie the modern faith in decentralization. Using logical analysis and formal modeling, and appealing to numerous examples, it shows that most are based on vague intuitions or partial views that do not withstand scrutiny.

"This paper uses fundamental principles of public choice, mainly the median voter theorem, to develop a simple theory of redistricting. The focus is on how closely policy outcomes correspond to majority rule. The main results are: (1) Potential policy bias in favor of nonmajority groups is structurally linked to the number of legislative seats and the population, and the structure of most states puts them very close to the theoretically maximum bias. (2) Random districting, which might seem like the essence of neutrality, does not eliminate policy bias on average. (3) Traditional principles of compact, contiguous districts that respect existing political boundaries, stressed in the Supreme Court's Shaw v. Reno decision, minimize the chance of nonmajoritarian outcomes.

"An enlightened philosopher-king would assess how alternative policies affect the welfare of society before choosing among them, but even a rapacious ""stationary bandit"" would almost certainly assess how alternative policies would affect the actual willingness and capacity of society to be taxed before making policy choices.1 At either extreme of this dictatorial spectrum, identifying relevant social values, crafting alternative policies, predicting the consequences of the policies, and assessing them in terms of the identified values-the craft of policy analysis-would be useful. A fundamental advantage of representative government, what some would argue is the fundamental advantage, 2 is that it allows the polity to eject stationary bandits as well as philosopher-kings (who, anyway, almost always become unenlightened) peacefully. Representative government, however, offers even more. It provides incentives for the articulation of interests and mechanisms for their influence on the choice of public policies. If all the interests of people are fully articulated and effectively represented, then the role of policy analysis primarily is one of design and prediction: specifying the necessary details of policy alternatives that arise in the political process and predicting their effects relevant to the interests of people in society. Yet interest articulation is incomplete, and interest representation is imperfect and, indeed, cannot be perfected.3 Consequently, policy analysis in representative government can play a valuable role, not only in specifying and predicting the consequences of alternative policies, but also in speaking for those interests in society that lack adequate articulation or representation in the arenas of collective choice. Most prominent among the interests deserving greater voice is efficiency. Copyright © 2006 the brookings institution.

"This paper investigates the political and economic determinants of successful fiscal adjustment in 25 emerging market economies from 1980 to 2001. The results show that large and back-loaded fiscal adjustments have the highest likelihood of success. Fiscal consolidations based on expenditure cuts increase the probability of approaching and achieving fiscal sustainability but are insufficient to maintain it unless accompanied by revenue reforms. Adjustment episodes launched in countries where governments enjoy a parliamentary majority and do not face imminent elections, are found to be more successful.

"A distributive politics model establishes that the presence of exogenously enforceable spending limits reduces spending and that the effect of executive veto authority is contingent on whether spending is capped and whether the chief executive is a liberal or conservative. Surprisingly, when spending limits are in place, governments with conservative executives spend more than those with more liberal chief executives. Limits are welfare improving, as is the executive veto when it leads to the building of override coalitions. Using 32 years of US state budget data, this paper also establishes empirically that strict balanced budget rules constrain spending and also lead to less pronounced short-term responses to fluctuations in a state's economy. Party variables like divided government and party control of state legislatures tend to have little or no direct effect, with political institutions and economic indicators explaining much of the variation in state spending. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",stop us before we spend again: institutional constraints on government spending,2006,Economics and Politics,"Primo, D.M.",Scopus,Final,Paper was included,467

"The budget is an expression of political rather than economic priorities. We confirm this proposition for a group of new and potential members of the European Union, finding that politics dominates. The contemporary practice of democracy can increase budget deficits through not only ideological preferences, but also more fragmented government coalitions and higher voter participation. Long-term structural forces, triggered by societal divisions and representative electoral rules, have more ambiguous implications but also appear to increase budget pressures, as others have also found. However, our most robust, and hopeful, finding is that budget institutions - mechanisms and rules of the budget process - that create checks and balances have significant value in curbing fiscal pressures even when the politics is representative but undisciplined, and when long-term structural forces are unfavourable. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2006.",can budget institutions counteract political indiscipline?,2006,Economic Policy,"Fabrizio, S., Mody, A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",469

"We review the use of macroeconomics in political science over the past 40 years. The field has been dominated by new classical theory, which leaves little room for economic policy and focuses attention on what democratic governments can do wrong in the short term. The resulting literatures on political business cycles and central bank independence are large and sophisticated, but they fail, we argue, to account for most of the observed variance in economic policies and outcomes. In the past decade, mainstream macroeconomics has moved away from new classical approaches toward New Keynesian theories with greater scope for macroeconomic policy. These new approaches, with little impact so far in political science, are reviewed and their implications drawn out.

Recent research integrates insights from political science, economics, and economic history in emphasizing the importance of incentives for the operation of decentralized government. Such work has focused particular attention on fiscal, representative, and party institutions. In reviewing the past decade's research, I make two arguments. First, the comparative research on decentralization and federalism provides a model for how comparative politics can address some of the most profound questions in social thought by focusing on a theoretically and empirically tractable aspect of governance. Second, although the research addresses many of the key questions in comparative politics, it also struggles with some of the same problems and challenges as comparative politics writ large, particularly the issue of institutional endogeneity.

"The horrifying, tragic events of 9/11 made Americans aware of their vulnerability to terrorist attacks and triggered the creation of the Department of Homeland Security along with a substantial increase in federal spending to both thwart terrorist attacks and to increase our ability to respond to such emergencies. Much of this large increase in spending was in the form of direct transfers to states and cities through several grant programs. Homeland Security grants may be used for protection against terrorist activities, thereby enhancing public interests, or as wealth transfers to state and local governments, enhancing the reelection efforts of incumbents, and thus, private interests. Using 2004 per capita Homeland Security grant funding to states and their cities, we find that the funding formula used for some of the grant programs, which allocates almost 40% of the funds in some grant programs through a minimum percent to each state with the rest allocated based on population, means that per capita funding is related to electoral votes per capita, i.e., to the politics of Presidential re-election. However, the funding in other grant programs is also related to some of the dangers and vulnerabilities faced by states and their cities. Some of the variation in per capita grant allocations is also explained by the amount of airport traffic in the state and the state's population density, which are variables closely linked to the state's vulnerability to attack. Per capita Homeland Security grant allocations, however, do not seem to be related to the closeness of the 2000 presidential race. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.",terrorism and pork-barrel spending,2006,Public Choice,"Coats, R.M., Karahan, G., Tollison, R.D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Using data from the 14 major states of India, we investigate whether state governments' fiscal policy choices are tempered by political considerations. Our principal findings are twofold. First, we show that certain fiscal policies experience electoral cycles: state governments raise less commodity tax revenue, spend less on the current account, and incur larger capital account developmental expenditures in election years than in all other years. Second, we show that coalition state governments raise less own non-tax revenues and spend less on the current account than state governments that are more cohesive in composition.

"Despite similar external shocks and pressures, Brazilian state leaders varied in the timing and the manner in which they adjusted to fiscal stress. Some state leaders rapidly switched to market-oriented strategies that cut public intervention in the economy. Other state leaders delayed adjustment, and when they finally put their accounts in order it was through market-governing strategies that preserved government activism. In part, these different fiscal policy regimes were products of the decision-making process in which chief executives operated. In states where budgeting obeyed a more open and democratic pattern, chief executives lacked autonomy and were forced to build coalitions to adjust. This meant that they adjusted more slowly and their adjustment strategies included appeals to broad interests, including those seeking protection from market pressures. In states where budgeting was more autocratic, chief executives could act quickly and without building a coalition. The current project uses structured comparison to contrast adjustment patterns in two democratic-budgeting states and two autocratic-budgeting states. The link between budget institutions and adjustment strategy appears to hold regardless of the socioeconomic condition of the states and the political hue of the state leaders. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",responding to fiscal stress: fiscal institutions and fiscal adjustment in four brazilian states,2006,Journal of Development Studies,"Schneider, A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article examines the policy consequences of the number of parties in government. We argue that parties externalize costs not borne by their support groups. Larger parties thus internalize more costs than small parties because they represent more groups. This argument implies that the public sector should be larger the more parties there are in the government coalition. We test this prediction using yearly time-series cross-sectional data from 1970 to 1998 in 17 European countries. We find that increasing the number of parties in government increases the fraction of GDP accounted for by government spending by close to half a percentage point, or more than one billion current dollars in the typical year. We find little support for the alternative claim that the number of legislative parties affects the size of the public sector, except via the number of parties in government. © 2006, Midwest Political Science Association.",short versus long coalitions: electoral accountability and the size of the public sector,2006,American Journal of Political Science,"Bawn, K., Rosenbluth, F.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",478

"We present a model where groups attempt to influence policies using both bribes (plata, Spanish for silver) and the threat of punishment (plomo, Spanish for lead). We then use it to make predictions about the quality of a country's public officials and to understand the role of institutions granting politicians with immunity from legal prosecution. The use of punishment lowers the returns from public office and reduces the incentives of high-ability citizens to enter public life. Cheaper plomo and more resources subject to official discretion are associated with more frequent corruption and less able politicians. This predicts that violence in a country will typically go together with corruption and worse politicians. Moreover, the possibility of punishment changes the nature of the influence game, so that even cheaper plata can lower the ability of public officials. Protecting officials from accusations of corruption (immunity) will decrease the frequency of corruption if the judiciary is weak and may increase the quality of politicians.

"This paper compares the Congressional budget process (instituted in 1974) and the piecemeal appropriations process that preceded it. Previous theoretical analysis using spatial models of legislator preferences finds no systematic difference in relative spending levels under the two regimes. This paper instead uses a model of interest group lobbying. A legislature determines spending on a national public good and on subsidies to sector-specific interest groups. In the ""appropriations process,"" the Appropriations Committee proposes a budget that, because of interest group influence, involves overspending on subsidies. In the ""budget process,"" the Budget Committee proposes an aggregate level of spending (the budget resolution); then, the Appropriations Committee proposes a budget. A free rider problem among the interest groups inhibits the lobbying of the Budget Committee to increase the aggregate budget. If each group is sufficiently small, it takes the budget resolution as given, and lobbies the Appropriations Committee. Aggregate spending is lower and social welfare is higher under the budget process; however, provision of the national public good is suboptimal.

"INTRODUCTION How does federalism affect policymaking? How do the details of the division of policy authority as well as expenditure and revenue powers across levels of government affect prospects for efficient and responsive governance? How does the economic, social, and political context – especially the recent wave of globalization and domestic economic liberalization – affect the workings of any given federal arrangements? These questions have given rise to a large and varied positive literature on the actual workings of federalism as well as a significant normative literature full of suggestions for how federations should allocate fiscal and other decision-making authority across several levels of government. The literature ranges from stylized models of the costs and benefits of different ways of allocating fiscal authority among social planners in closed economies to detailed research on the nuances of interactions among levels of government in particular countries, time periods, and policy areas. On one end of the spectrum of research on federalism, national and subnational governments are assumed to act as benevolent social planners who are omniscient and omnipotent, with national planners capable of addressing any externalities from subnational social planners' actions that spill over from one region to another. Social planners at all levels are assumed to have all the relevant information and capacity for enforcement of their decisions. Opportunistic behavior is assumed to be nonexistent. Evaluating fiscal federalism in a closed-economy setting is another common simplification used to keep models tractable and implications for federal design and function clear. © Cambridge University Press 2006 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",analyzing federalism: stylized models and the political economy reality,2006,Federalism and Economic Reform: International Perspectives,"Wallack, J.S., Srinivasan, T.N.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article analyses the role of parties in political systems with legislative initiative. The model explicitly takes into account the multi-district nature of elections so that voters recognize that they are not voting for a policy but for members of a policy-making body. In this setting, parties can attain their ideological goals without resorting to extreme discipline of their members in the legislature. With respect to the electorate, although voters are endowed with perfect information about their candidates' ideological stance, this model explains how the legislature will display correlation across ideology and party, a feature often attributed to imperfect information. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.",party discipline with legislative initiative,2006,British Journal of Political Science,"Medina, L.F.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The size of the U.S. federal government, as well as state and local governments, increased dramatically during the 20th century. This paper reviews several theories of government size and growth that are dominant in the public choice and political science literature. The theories are divided into two categories: citizen-over-state theories and state-over-citizen theories. The relationship between the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the timing of government growth is also presented. It is likely that portions of each theory can explain government size and growth, but the challenge facing economists is to develop a single unifying theory of government growth. © 2006, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",on the size and growth of government,2006,Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review,"Garrett, T.A., Rhine, R.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A large and growing body of research is devoted to the effects of social capital on institutional performance. This literature reveals that societies characterized by higher levels of social capital tend to achieve superior performance. Still, enquiries to date predominantly concentrate on country-level data or large sub-national units. The primary purpose of this article is to extend the empirical work to the local government level, while retaining the use of objective data to gauge institutional performance. This use of local data has the advantage of increasing the data set available and provides a more stringent test of the effect of social capital because social capital is likely to vary less at lower levels of government. The results - based on an empirical analysis of 305 Flemish municipalities in 2000 - support the view that social capital leads to government (out)performance also at the local level of government.

"The essence of democracy is popular sovereignty. The people rule. In the United States, citizens exercise this right through elected officials who they believe will best represent their own values and interests. But are those interests and values always being followed? Authors Michael B. Berkman and Eric Plutzer provide the first systematic examination of the extent to which the governments closest to the American public?its 10,000-plus local school boards?respond to the wishes of the majority. Ten Thousand Democracies begins with a look at educational reforms from the Progressive era in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the civil rights movement and ending with Pennsylvania's 2004 tax relief measure. Berkman and Plutzer explore what factors determine education spending levels in school districts, including the effects of public opinion, the nature of local political institutions, and the roles played by special interests. The authors show how board members are selected, how well the boards represent minorities, whether the public can bypass the board through referenda, and how the schools are financed. By providing an innovative statistical portrait that combines public opinion data with Census data for these school districts, the authors answer questions central to democratic control of our schools: how responsive are school boards to their public and when? How powerful are such special interests such as teachers' unions and senior citizens? By using the lens of America's public school districts to examine the workings of democracy, Ten Thousand Democracies offers new insight not only into the forces shaping local education policy but also how democratic institutions may function throughout all levels of government. © 2005 by Georgetown University Press.

"We present a dynamic model of fiscal policy in a simple growth framework where social polarization (of preferences) plays a central role in the evolution of fiscal instability and growth collapse. In a highly polarized society, a deficit occurs endogenously, fiscal spending path becomes more volatile, output collapses, and economic growth rate is reduced along the transition path to a new lower level of output. One novel feature is that the size of fiscal deficit, the magnitude of fiscal volatility, and the size of reduction in output and growth rate are explicitly shown to be increasing functions of the degree of social polarization. This is because of the positive relationship between the polarization of preferences and the incentive for policymakers (or socio-economic groups) to overexploit the government resources in a common pool setting (polarization effect). Thereby, we offer a fiscal instability channel that negatively links social polarization and growth, which is an alternative yet distinct explanation for the empirical finding that social polarization is harmful to growth. Moreover, we fully distinguish the incentive to engage in such short-term policies under political uncertainty from that under polarization. Polarization and political uncertainty are shown to be distinct yet critical to the dynamic coordination failure in the common pool setting. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"The Weak Government Hypothesis states that government fragmentation leads to higher public deficits and debt. This relation can be explained by government inaction, common pool problems or the strategic use of debt that arise in coalition governments. Importantly, whereas government inaction models concentrate on the short-term effects of government fragmentation on indebtedness, common pool and strategic debt models imply that such effects will persist in the long term. We test these hypotheses using a large panel of data on municipal debt in 298 Flemish municipalities (1977-2000). We find that there is no long-run effect from weak governments. However, there is general support for the fact that the number of parties in a coalition has a positive effect on the municipality's short-term debt levels-in line with government inaction models. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",government weakness and local public debt development in flemish municipalities,2005,International Tax and Public Finance,"Ashworth, J., Geys, B., Heyndels, B.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",498
"Using a panel of budgetary data over the period 1989-1996, we analyse how political fragmentation of Flemish local governments affects their reactions in the context of a major reform of the grant system. This reform reallocated grants among municipalities and thus unavoidably created ""winners"" and ""losers"". Thus, it is possible to distinguish between political reactions in good and bad times. The presence of a balanced budget requirement implies that in bad times municipalities have to react whereas in good times the decision to react is endogenous to the government. The results are in line with the hypotheses, if not the findings, of Kontopoulos and Perotti (1999) in that we find that fragmentation is important both in good and in bad times. Coalition size - the number of political parties - plays a crucial role when the budgetary shock is endogenous (in ""good times"" when grants increase). In this case, we find that more-party governments spend more of the additional funds. On the other hand, cabinet size - the number of spending ministers (aldermen) - is the relevant dimension of fragmentation when the reaction is exogenous (in ""bad times""). When grants are cut back, expenditures are cut back more in municipalities with fewer ministers. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.","government fragmentation and budgetary policy in ""good"" and ""bad"" times in flemish municipalities",2005,Economics and Politics,"Ashworth, J., Heyndels, B.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Many policies in the United States are jointly determined by federal and state actions. In the game theoretic model offered here, politicians in both the state and national governments seek credit for providing goods desired by the public and avoid blame for the taxes necessary to provide the goods. In line with Peterson's (1995) theory of functional federalism, the level of government that is better able to supply particular goods and services tends to take the lead in their provision, even to the extent of fully crowding out much less efficient governments. However, under a broad set of circumstances, both state and national politicians seek credit via public spending, and their joint provision leads to a relative ""oversupply"" of public goods and services, and thus to ""overtaxation.""

The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of contracting incompleteness. Such incompleteness can emerge from various sources, which we present and discuss. We then study the case of a politically chosen decision-maker and the consequences of its inability to commit for more than one period and of the ability for individuals to form groups.

"Between 1842 and 1852, eleven states adopted new constitutions, simultaneously creating procedures for issuing government debt and for chartering corporations through general incorporation acts. Why simultaneously? Voters wanted geographically specific infrastructure investments but opposed geographically widespread taxation. States resolved the dilemma by developing several innovative public finance schemes. One, ""taxless finance,"" used borrowed funds and special corporate privileges without raising current taxes. Another scheme, ""benefit taxation,"" coordinated the incidence of taxes with the geographic benefits of investments through the property tax. After the fiscal crisis of the early 1840s, states changed their constitutions to eliminate taxless finance in the future. © The Economic History Association.

" It is widely believed that direct democracy, in the form of the initiative, brought about cuts in state taxes and spending over the last quarter century. This belief is based on firsthand observation, case studies, and more than a dozen statistical studies (Matsusaka 2004). Marschall and Ruhil (2005) focus on one of the central issues in this literature: Did the initiative cause this perceived reduction in taxes and spending, or was there some unmeasured factor that led to adoption of the initiative as well as spending and tax cuts? Previous research addressed this problem of spurious correlation in a variety of ways, ranging from detailed examinations of specific cases (for example, Gerber et al. 2001) to explicit attempts to control for missing vari- ables (for example, Matsusaka 1995 and Merrifield 2000). Marschall and Ruhil approach the problem using instrumental variables and arrive at a conclusion diametrically opposite from the previous literature: the initiative increased spending and taxes. This comment explains why that surprising conclusion is probably mis- taken. Marschall and Ruhil are to be applauded for applying careful empirical techniques to an important problem, and their article lays down valuable methodological tracks for other researchers to follow. However, their empiri cal results are fragile, and their model specification can be rejected on both theoretical and empirical grounds.

"In the ""bargaining democracy"" groups form coalitions that are able to grant benefits to themselves through legislation. These benefits may lack popular support. A constitutional hierarchy of conflicting laws is proposed to resolve this democratic problem. In the hierarchy more ""rule-oriented"" legislation dominate. The hierarchy would create a momentum of the political process towards more rule-oriented legislation and policy debate.

"In most major democracies there are very few parties compared tothe numberof possible policy positions held by voters. We provide an efficiency rationale for why it might be appropriate to limit the proliferation of parties. In our model, the larger the number of parties, the greater the inefficiency of the outcome of electoral competition. The reason is that, when the number of parties increases, electoral incentives push each party to focus its electoral promises on a narrower constituency, and then special interest policies replace more efficient policies that have diffuse benefits. The analysis provides a possible explanation for the existence of institutional features that limit the extent of electoral competition: thresholds of exclusion, runoff electoral systems, and majoritarian two-party political systems. © 2005 by the European Economic Association.",a drawback of electoral competition,2005,Journal of the European Economic Association,"Lizzeri, A., Persico, N.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Budgeting can be understood as a common resource pool problem where spending agencies have incentives to encourage excessive levels of current spending and reduce budget surplus or create budget deficits. The political leadership is assumed to have an important role in keeping fiscal control and resisting the high-demanders' pressure for increased spending. Three factors of relevance for their success are investigated: political characteristics (political colour and political strength, the strength of relevant interest groups) and two institutional characteristics - committee structure and budgeting procedures. The analyses are based on panel data from up to 434 Norwegian municipalities in the period from 1991 to 1998. The results support the hypothesis that strong political leadership improves fiscal performance. The effect of interest groups is to a high degree community-specific. However, an increased share of elderly reduces fiscal surplus. Differences in budgetary procedures do not seem to affect fiscal performance. A strong committee structure seems, on the other hand, to result in better fiscal performance than a weaker one.","political characteristics, institutional procedures and fiscal performance: panel data analyses of norwegian local governments, 1991-1998",2005,European Journal of Political Research,"Hagen, T.P., Vabo, S.I.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Several recent studies have investigated the relationship between direct democracy and public policy outcomes, with mixed findings. These inconsistencies may stem, in part, from researchers' failure to recognize that direct democracy institutions are distributed nonrandomly across the American states. That is, certain factors may lead a state to adopt the initiative process and influence other policy choices. We revisit the question of how the initiative influences state fiscal policy using panel data from 1960-2000 and a full-information maximum likelihood estimator that explicitly accounts for the endogeneity of the initiative. Our findings suggest that failure to endogenize the initiative in empirical analyses leads to substantially biased estimates of its effects. In particular, we find that once factors that predict whether a state has adopted the initiative are controlled, the initiative has a positive effect on state revenue generation and spending. © 2005 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.",fiscal effects of the voter initiative reconsidered: addressing endogeneity,2005,State Politics and Policy Quarterly,"Marschall, M.J., Ruhil, A.V.S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",509
"In the Elf Aquitaine scandals the informality of French politics prevented control agencies from preventing corruption.

"As new federations take shape and old ones are revived around the world, a difficult challenge is to create incentives for fiscal discipline. A key question is whether a politically-motivated central government can credibly commit not to bail out subnational governments in times of crisis if it funds most of their expenditures. The center can commit when subnational governments retain significant tax autonomy, as in the United States. Or if the center dominates taxation, it can tightly regulate borrowing, as in many unitary systems. In a third group of countries including Brazil and Germany, the center can neither commit to a system of market-based discipline nor gain a monopoly over borrowing. By combining theory, quantitative analysis, and historical and contemporary case studies, this book explains why different countries have had dramatically different experiences with subnational fiscal discipline. © Jonathan A.

"Scholars of the U.S. House disagree over the importance of political parties in organizing the legislative process. On the one hand, non-partisan theories stress how congressional organization serves members’ non-partisan goals. On the other hand, partisan theories argue that the House is organized to serve the collective interests of the majority party. This book advances our partisan theory and presents a series of empirical tests of that theory’s predictions (pitted against others).

"This book, first published in 2005, develops a comparative model of intergovernmental bargaining to account for variation in the capacity of federations in the developing world to undertake economic policy reform, suggesting that many market reform policies are a function of a constant process of bargaining between national and regional leaders struggling for political survival. As the degree of national-regional disagreement mounts, collective action on reforms that require implementation at multiple levels of government becomes more difficult. The degree to which the two factors conflict depends on four factors: the individual electoral interests, a shared intergovernmental fiscal system, the manner in which regional interests are represented in national policy making and the levers of partisan influence national leaders have over subnational politicians. In testing the argument with a combination of cross-sectional time-series and case study analysis, this book contributes to the broad literatures on development and the comparative political economy of federalism and decentralization. © Erik Wibbels and Cambridge University Press, 2005.",federalism and the market: intergovernmental conflict and economic reform in the developing world,2005,Federalism and the Market Intergovernmental Conflict and Economic Reform in the Developing World,"Wibbels, E.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This volume assembles and presents a new database on bank regulation in over 150 countries (included also on CD). It offers the first comprehensive cross-country assessment of the impact of bank regulation on the operation of banks, and assesses the validity of the Basel Committee's influential approach to bank regulation. The treatment also provides an empirical evaluation of the historic debate about the proper role of government in the economy by studying bank regulation and analyzes the role of politics in determining regulatory approaches to banking. The data also indicate that restrictions on the entry of new banks, government ownership of banks, and restrictions on bank activities hurt banking system performance.

"Although Indonesia has the fourth largest population in the world, its history is still relatively unknown. Adrian Vickers takes the reader on a journey across the social and political landscape of modern Indonesia, starting with the country's origins under the Dutch in the early twentieth-century, and the subsequent anti-colonial revolution which led to independence in 1949. Thereafter the spotlight is on the 1950s, a crucial period in the formation of Indonesia as a new nation, followed by the Sukarno years, and the anti-Communist massacres of the 1960s when General Suharto took over as president. The concluding chapters chart the fall of Suharto's New Order after thirty two years in power, and the subsequent political and religious turmoil which culminated in the Bali bombings in 2002. Adrian Vickers is Professor of Asian Studies at the University of Wollongong. He has previously worked at the Universities of New South Wales and Sydney, and has been a visiting fellow at the University of Indonesia and Udayana University (Bali).

"This study examines the benefit hypothesis from distributive theory to test the assumption that the Department of Housing and Urban Development selected cities for an empowerment zone or enterprise community based on political favoritism in 1994. With data collected from the 290 urban applications, the independent variables in the ordinal logit regression model include oversight committee assignments in the House of Representatives, seniority, poverty, population, and award status sought by cities. The regression output provides support for the benefit hypothesis; the influence of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the program's primary funding source, is significant. However, the results of the district level coefficients question to some extent the argument that non-political factors (e.g., poverty and internal dynamics) were important to the agency's decision-making calculus.

"For at least a century, the United States has enjoyed unbridled prosperity. True, there have been significant interruptions in the upward course of per capita growth, most notably during the Great Depression. Although we could not always answer positively to Ronald Reagan's famous 1980 presidential debate question, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" most of us are unambiguously better off than our grandparents were fifty years ago, or their grandparents fifty years earlier.1 The distribution of prosperity, however, unlike the aggregate, has not followed a monotonic path. The broad outline of what happened is easy to summarize. Inequality in income and wealth decreased for much of the twentieth century. The decrease in inequality appeared to fit the hypothesis of Simon Kuznets (1955): As industrialization led a larger fraction of the population to enter high-productivity activities, inequality fell. The fall in inequality, however, has been arrested and reversed. When inequality started to rise depends on which measure one uses, but the reversal did not start before the late 1960s and was clearly in full bloom before-not after-Reagan took office. In this essay, I document that the long-run trend in inequality-decreasing for roughly the first three-quarters of the twentieth century and increasing thereafter-is matched by similar trends in public policy and political polarization, and I discuss the implications of these parallel trends. I focus on public policies, such as taxes and minimum wages, that are tied to inequality, since they are explicitly redistributive. For example, David Lee (1999, 979) finds that ""almost all of the growth in the wage gap between the tenth and fiftieth percentile is attributable to the erosion of the real value of the federal minimum during the [1980s]."" Estate taxes became more onerous for the first three-quarters of the century before reversing in the late 1970s. Top marginal income taxes increased before starting a decline in the 1960s. The federal minimum wage took root in 1938 and increased, in real terms, until the late 1960s but then declined precipitously. I later document in more detail how minimum wages and taxes closely tracked the secular pattern of inequality. As inequality among Americans fell during the first two-thirds or three-quarters of the twentieth century, Americans also seemed to have grown closer together politically. In 1960 the sociologist Daniel Bell published The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties. A year later the political scientist Robert Dahl (1961) pointed to a nation moving from oligarchy to pluralism. Similarly, the new ""rational choice"" school in political science emphasized Tweedle-Dee-Tweedle-Dum parties focused on the median voter (Downs 1957) and members of Congress largely concerned with constituency service (Fiorina 1978) and universalism in pork barrel politics (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). What these authors pointed to was echoed in analyses of roll-call voting patterns in the House and Senate. Put simply, the fraction of moderates grew and the fraction of extreme liberals and extreme conservatives fell from 1900 to about 1975 (Poole and Rosenthal 1997; McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal 1997). Just as inequality went from falling to rising in the last quarter of the century, we witnessed a turnaround in politics. Keith Poole and I have termed this ""the polarization of American politics"" (Poole and Rosenthal 1984; see also Krugman 2002a, 2002b). Moderates are nearly extinct. Extreme liberals and extreme conservatives have surfaced, particularly extreme conservatives in the Republican Party. What, more precisely, are the changes in partisan positions that underlie polarization? The Republican Party in Congress moves from a very conservative position in 1900 to a substantially more moderate position in the 1970s before rebounding to 1900 conservatism in 2000. The Democratic Party becomes more moderate until the 1950s and then drifts, relatively slowly, to a more liberal position. The net effect of these changes is that the differences between the parties-polarization- narrow until the 1970s and then expand. My main focus-stimulated by the parallel trends in economic inequality, political polarization, and public policy-is on how politics and economic inequality relate and are coupled by economic policy. There is, in this respect, an abundance of alternative hypotheses about the rise of inequality. The list includes greater trade liberalization, increased levels of immigration, declining rates of trade unionization, the fall in the real minimum wage, a decline in progressive taxation, technological change increasing the returns to education, the increased rates of family dissolution and female-headed households, the aging of the population, pure racism, America's federal political system, gridlocked national politics, and the absence of proportional representation in elections (for an overview of some of these topics, see Atkinson 1997; see also Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacredote 2001). Most of these factors are either directly political or potentially affected by public policy. Technological change, however, would appear to respond to many forces that are independent of government policy. Similarly, the decline of marriage is universal throughout the Western world. The roots of this may be just as much in technological changes that affect work in the household and in changes in lifestyle as in the changes in incentives produced through welfare and other public policies. Nonetheless, politics and public policy remain the focus of this essay. An important aspect of the increase in inequality is that it has indeed taken place during a period of substantial economic growth. Although the quadrupling, from 1970 to 2000, of the proportion of the population who are incarcerated (Western, Kleykamp, and Rosenfeld, this volume) suggests that many African American males may not be better off than their grandparents, by and large the increase in inequality is not a matter of pauperization. 2 Although there is debate as to whether the lower end of the income distribution is somewhat worse off or has remained relatively stable in economic status, it has pretty clearly not gotten much worse off. Moreover, a substantial segment of the lower tail consists of immigrants who are much better off than they were in their nation of origin. At the same time, in the middle and at the top end of the income distribution, voters have become much richer. This is not just because the growth rate of income at each centile has been increasing in the centile. The poor who are eligible to vote increasingly vote less than the rich. In addition, nonvoting legal and illegal immigrants tend to be poor. Another factor, but quantitatively less important than immigration, arises from growth in the number of incarcerated Americans and ineligible ex-felons (on both criminals and immigrants in voter turnout, see McDonald and Popkin 2001). Prosperity, immigration, and criminal justice policy combine to mute the political response to inequality. This chapter proposes an account of the political and institutional forces that are likely to blunt a movement toward redistributive economic policies. Rising wealth and incomes have created a sizable constituency with a vested interest in the status quo, while the growing share of noncitizens and disenfranchised ex-offenders reduces the political power of the poor. As I discuss later, these shifts in the electorate take place in the context of institutional features of the American political system that give economic policies a kind of ""stickiness,"" particularly given the polarization discussed earlier. Once established, economic policies that affect the distribution of income tend to be slow to change. The essay proceeds as follows. A theoretical overview of the political economy of inequality is provided in the next section. This section also briefly applies the theoretical perspective to an understanding of events in the twentieth century. In the following section, I make some international comparisons and highlight how the Great Depression, World War II, and the 1960s represented exceptional events for the United States. I suggest how politics might be relevant to differences in inequality across nations. In the next section, I document the polarization of politics in the United States. The following section links that political polarization to outcomes in income and wealth inequality and immigration. That is followed by a section in which I argue that increases in aggregate income and wealth and in immigration are acting to mute any political response to inequality. Finally, I show how changes in public policies on taxes and minimum wages correspond with changes in inequality and political polarization. This section also emphasizes that old-age insurance taxes follow an entirely different pattern from taxation that is explicitly redistributive.

"The Political Economy of Expertise is a carefully argued examination of how legislatures use expert research and testimony. Kevin Esterling demonstrates that interest groups can actually help the legislative process by encouraging Congress to assess research and implement well-informed policies. More than mere touts for the interests of Washington insiders, these groups encourage Congress to enact policies that are likely to succeed while avoiding those that have too great of a risk of failure. The surprising result is greater legislative efficiency.

"In most studies of the impact of ethnic diversity on economic growth, diversity is hypothesized to affect growth through its effect on macroeconomic policies. This article shows that most measures of ethnic diversity (including the commonly used ELF measure) are inappropriate for testing this hypothesis. This is because they are constructed from enumerations of ethnic groups that include all of the ethnographically distinct groups in a country irrespective of whether or not they engage in the political competition whose effects on macroeconomic policymaking are being tested. I present a new index of ethnic fractionalization based on an accounting of politically relevant ethnic groups in 42 African countries. I employ this measure (called PREG, for Politically Relevant Ethnic Groups) to replicate Easterly and Levine's influential article on Africa's ""growth tragedy.""

"This paper treats interest groups - people in their role as consumers of a public good and people in their role as taxpayers - as the unit of account for representative voting. Each group is allowed to make an effort to support its preferred candidate and, at the margin, the effort-benefit ratio is the political price the group is willing to pay to secure an additional dollar of benefits. Under reasonable assumptions, a unique equilibrium is assured and its characteristics are quite intuitive. In particular, the marginal political benefit (from consumers) of the last unit of output must equal the marginal political cost (from taxpayers). Alternatively, the rate at which the politician can transform taxpayer income into consumer surplus must equal the ratio of their political prices. The result will be optimal only on the rare occasion when the effort-benefit ratios of the two groups are equal. Since political goals are themselves ""public goods"" for the two interest groups, they face all the normal free rider problems. Moreover, even small differences in the effort-benefit ratios of the two groups lead to large welfare losses. How bad can things get? Each group has an incentive to try to overcome free-rider problems and divert resources from private sector activities to politics. And any increase in political effort is always rewarded. However, (1) the marginal return is always higher for the group with the smaller effort-benefit ratio; (2) the differential return between the two groups grows the further we stray from optimality; and (3) both groups face diminishing returns. These incentives may act as natural checks on political outcomes - placing some limit on the amount of waste and inefficiency democracy is likely to produce. The influence of a producer (of the public good) group that collects a rent increases the likelihood that public goods will be overproduced. In fact, it is conceivable to have a good with no value to consumers produced, solely because of the influence of producers. Comparative static analysis reveal that the political system will respond to changes in market conditions in a way similar to economic markets. The magnitude of these shifts differs from economic markets, however. For goods that are being overproduced, the political marketplace overresponds to changes in demand and underresponds to changes in costs. The converse is true for goods that are being underproduced.",political equilibrium and the provision of public goods,2004,Public Choice,"Goodman, J.C., Porter, P.K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This interdisciplinary study finds that the laws are written and treated by state regulators measurably affects bureaucratic performance: the care taken by legislatures and state agencies in developing domestic elder abuse law affects how lower-level bureaucrats investigate and reporte abuse. Perhaps more interesting, however, are two robust findings about state law making. Both legislator characteristics (here, being middle-aged or slightly older) and lobbying by seemingly the most important interest group (here, the American Association of Retired Persons [AARP]) sometimes have an unexpected effect. We surmise that these legislators and lobbyists find other issues both more politically attractive and more pressing since elder abuse is almost exclusively confined to the very old and helpless.

"Local public goods financed from a national tax base provide concentrated benefits to recipient jurisdictions but disperse costs, creating incentives for legislators to increase own-district spending but to restrain aggregate spending due to the associated tax costs. While these common pool incentives underpin a variety of theoretical analyses, which tend to predict inefficiencies in the allocation of public goods, there is little direct evidence that individual legislators respond to such incentives. To test for reactions to such incentives, this paper analyzes 1998 Congressional votes over transportation project funding. The empirical results provide evidence that legislators respond to common pool incentives: the probability of supporting the projects is increasing in own-district spending and decreasing in the tax burden associated with aggregate spending. Having found that legislators do respond to such incentives, I use the parameter estimates to calculate the efficient level of public goods, which suggest over-spending in aggregate, especially in politically powerful districts, and large associated deadweight loss. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"In recent decades, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain-along with most industrial countries-witnessed a sharp rise in the size of government and a large accumulation of public debt. While the latter trend began to reverse under the constraints imposed by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, public expenditure and debt remain high by international standards. These are well-recognized sources of concern to policymakers, especially as the rapid aging of the population increases spending on pensions and health care while reducing the labor force and therefore economic growth and the tax base. This paper studies the design of fiscal rules and frameworks, with particular reference to France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In different ways, these countries face substantial public finance challenges over the next decade: high levels of outstanding public debt (Italy in particular), the consequences of a rapidly aging population for future social spending, and the need to ensure adequate scope for reduction of the still-high tax burden while maintaining an adequate level of public sector capital spending. This study argues that the four countries should place more emphasis on spending rules within the boundaries set by the Stability and Growth Pact. At present, fiscal frameworks are geared to achieving medium-term balances around zero. En route, annual deficits are meant to follow declining paths, as articulated in each country's Stability Program. This paper suggests that countries should maintain medium-term targets for the budget balance-or alternatively, the stock of public debt-geared to long-term policy objectives. But it points out that rigid adherence to annual deficit targets can impart a procyclical bias to fiscal policy through contractionary measures to buttress revenues in a downswing and a temptation to spend windfall tax receipts in an upswing.","rules-based fiscal policy in france, germany, italy, and spain",2003,IMF Occasional Papers,"Dában, T., Detragiache, E., di Bella, G., Milesi-Ferretti, G.M., Symansky, S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",534
"This paper takes a fresh look at the trade-off between centralized and decentralized provision of local public goods. It argues that the sharing of the costs of local public spending in a centralized system will create a conflict of interest between citizens in different jurisdictions. When spending decisions are made by a legislature of locally elected representatives, this conflict of interest will play out in the legislature. Depending on precisely how the legislature behaves, the result may be excessive public spending or allocations of public goods characterized by uncertainty and misallocation across districts. The extent of the conflict of interest between districts is affected by spillovers and differences in tastes for public spending. Thus, the relative performance of centralized and decentralized systems depends upon spillovers and differences in tastes for public spending, but for different reasons than suggested in the existing literature. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"Forty-three of the fifty states of the United States have granted item veto authority to their governors as part of state constitutions. In this paper, I test explanations of why and when a legislature would cede institutional power. Using data from 1865 to 1994, I show that these measures are most likely proposed by fiscal conservatives who fear the loss of power in the future; in order to protect their interests for those periods when they will be in the minority, they implement institutions such as the item veto which will limit future, liberal legislatures. The results therefore shed light on two important substantive areas. First, by showing how the choice of budgetary institutions is endogenous to the political process, it clarifies that political factors must be considered in addition to social efficiency to understand the adoption of budget institutions. Second, it provides evidence in support of theories that have posited that electorally weak groups will heavily 'insulate' policies in periods in which they momentarily hold power (e.g. Moe, 1989; de Figueiredo, 2002). © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"Balassone and Franco note that while the budget rules that frame EMU apply to national States, several EMU member nations are already organised on a federal basis and others, pressed by political and economic needs, have started to enact reforms aimed at increasing the degree of decentralisation. They highlight several critical areas in the interaction of fiscal decentralisation and the Stability and Growth Pact. Balassone and Franco point to the reduced flexibility of the European approach compared with solutions adopted in federally structured countries and to the asymmetry between the responsibilities laid on national and local governments by European rules (compliance with the rules depends on the conduct of all levels of government, but de facto it is the central government that is answerable to the EU and that must pay the price for non-compliance). This calls for strict controls over local governments to prevent free-riding. The authors examine alternative solutions to deal with these problems, such as the mechanical extension of the Stability and Growth Pact, the introduction of a golden rule for decentralised governments, also in the form of a market for deficit permits, and the use of reserve funds. Finally, Balassone and Franco analyse how the issue has been addressed in Italy through the introduction of the Domestic Stability Pact and stress the need for further significant refinements of these domestic rules.",fiscal federalism and the stability and growth pact: a difficult union,2003,"Economic Welfare, International Business and Global Institutional Change","Balassone, F., Franco, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We analyze a simple stochastic environment in which policy makers can be threatened by ""nasty"" interest groups. In the absence of these groups, the policy maker's desire for reelection guarantees that good policies are implemented for every realization of the shock. When pressure groups can harass the policy maker, good policies will be chosen for only a subset of states of nature. Hence, honest and able leaders might implement bad policies, and needed reforms could be delayed. In order to make good policies more likely, the public will want to increase the cost of exerting pressure for ""nasty groups"" and provide rents to those in power. This last result can be used to explain the existence of political parties. They play a role of resembling that of the supervisor in the literature on collusion in hierarchical agency.

"Previous theoretical and empirical research has shown that policymakers have incentives to centralize government activities in order to weaken the competitive pressure of fiscal federalism. We argue that referendums reduce the possibilities for collusion among representatives and the ability of higher level policy-makers to attract additional responsibilities. Empirical results from panel data for Swiss cantons between 1980 to 1998 support this hypothesis. The centralization of government activity, measured by budgetary outcomes, is significantly reduced by a fiscal referendum. This holds in the case of public revenue and its components, but also for public expenditure, in particular public education spending.",government centralization in a referendum de- mocracy: evidence from switzerland [die zentralisierung der staatstätigkeit in einer referendumsdemokratie: evidenz aus der schweiz],2003,Politische Vierteljahresschrift,"Schaltegger, C.A., Feld, L.P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article revisits the influential ""Leviathan"" hypothesis, which posits that tax competition limits the growth of government spending in decentralized countries. I use panel data to examine the effect of fiscal decentralization over time within countries, attempting to distinguish between decentralization that is funded by intergovernmental transfers and local taxation. First, I explore the logic whereby decentralization should restrict government spending if state and local governments have wide-ranging authority to set the tax base and rate, especially on mobile assets. In countries where this is most clearly the case, decentralization is associated with smaller government. Second, consistent with theoretical arguments drawn from welfare economics and positive political economy, I show that governments grow faster as they fund a greater portion of public expenditures through intergovernmental transfers.",reviving leviathan: fiscal federalism and the growth of government,2003,International Organization,"Rodden, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",541

Conversely, as the size of the majority party grows from a bare-minimum majority to above the supermajority level, it has a nonlinear, specifically ""cube"" effect on central government expenditure.

The results corroborate the theoretical claims and are robust in regression models where fixed-effects were introduced and endogeneity was corrected.

"Correcting the relative lack of attention to the supply side of trade policy, this article addresses how political institutions channel societal demands for protection. I hypothesize that strong presidents with significant legislative powers and strong party leaders - empowered through electoral rules that rein in the personal vote - can help overcome protectionist biases. These arguments compare with two institutional alternatives: first, that protectionism should decrease as electoral district size grows because elections become more proportional; and second, that the collective-action problems in fragmented party systems thwart trade reform. I evaluate these hypotheses empirically using pooled time-series-cross-sectional data involving 18 developing countries from 1971 to 1997. I find that delegation to presidents and party leaders is significantly related to trade liberalization, and some evidence suggests that the effective number of parties and the size of electoral districts may also influence levels of protectionism.",supplying trade reform: political institutions and liberalization in middle-income presidential democracies,2003,American Journal of Political Science,"Nielson, D.L.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",544
"Recent research on federations, particularly in the developing world, emphasizes the importance of hard budget constraints and a strong central government to attenuate intergovernmental economic conflicts. Such research fails on two counts. First, it does not explain how hard budget constraints emerge or become self-enforcing. Second, it does not take into account the insight of the market-preserving federalism literature that central governments strong enough to impose restraint on regions are likely too powerful to be checked in a manner consistent with the long-term health of markets. Unfortunately, the market-preserving federalism literature itself provides little insight into how to move from a market-distorting to a market-preserving equilibrium. This article answers these theoretical shortcomings with reference to the evolution of political competition at the regional level and the representation of those regions at the national level. More specifically, whereas regional competition determines the subnational demand for soft budget constraints, the coalition of those regions at the national level determines the likelihood of their provision. Empirically, the research relies on a case study of the state debt crisis of the 1840s when the United States made a definitive movement toward market-preserving federalism.","bailouts, budget constraints, and leviathans comparative federalism and lessons from the early united states",2003,Comparative Political Studies,"Wibbels, E.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",545

"We provide a definition of institutionalism and a schematic account that differentiates between institutional theories (in which institutions are exogenous) and theories of institutions, in which some (but not necessarily all) institutions are endogenous. Our primary argument is that institutionalism in the contemporary context is better characterized as a method than as a body of substantive work motivated by the so-called chaos problem. Secondary arguments include the following. (1) While it is important to differentiate sharply between institutions and behavior, institutionalism presupposes a well-defined behavioral concept. (2) When making the challenging transition from developing institutional theories to developing theories of institutions, it is essential to hold behavioral axioms fixed and to choose a form of equilibrium that exists for the class of games studied.

"Government program allocations are more stable and more equally shared than theory predicts. Although various explanations have been offered, we emphasize the high transaction costs of political negotiations and coalition enforcement. Cycling predictions ignore the cost to politicians of repeatedly forming coalitions and neglect the opportunity costs of failed coalitions and the loss of related government programs that bring valuable constituent benefits. Because of these costs, Congress relies on coalitions larger than the minimum necessary to enact a program, adopts relatively egalitarian programmatic sharing rules, and resists efforts to change those allocations.

"Consider a public project that produces a consumption good that benefits future generations. Let a conventional cost-benefit analysis find that it gives higher benefits than projects it would displace in the private sector.

In contrast, private projects have owners, allowing parents to control whether their children will receive the benefits from such projects.

"We examine a large set of economic, sociopolitical, and institutional variables in a panel of 57 developed and developing countries over the period of 1970-1990 to derive robust conclusions about which variables are important in explaining cross-country differences in public sector deficits. Financial depth, income inequality, assassinations, cabinet size, and centralization of authority in budgetary decisions are found to be significant and robust determinants of public deficits. We also propose a working hypothesis and provide supporting econometric evidence: social polarization is important in explaining differences in fiscal outcomes across countries, yet its effects may be even more pronounced or suppressed, depending on the political and institutional structures through which social polarization is linked to the fiscal policy-making process. Indeed, effects on public deficits of the sociopolitical variables tend to be smaller in countries with better institutional arrangements. Conversely, the sociopolitical polarization has very strong effects on deficits in the presence of poor institutions.

"This article examines state government spending patterns for capital projects during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a function of some of the institutional arrangements and procedural characteristics of state legislatures. The analysis is informed by the literature on distributive policymaking, which argues that lawmakers seek to send targetable benefits, such as capital projects, to their constituencies in pursuit of personal electoral benefits. Using a pooled, cross-sectional time-series approach, the authors find that states with a large number of seats in the lower chambers of their legislatures devoted a somewhat smaller portion of their state budgets to capital projects than did states with smaller lower chambers, ceteris paribus. Contrary to some log-rolling models, the number of appropriations bills employed by a legislature seems to discourage capital spending, as does membership turnover in the upper chamber. This indicates that the capital budgeting process is not nearly as dominated by the executive branch as is commonly believed. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",an analysis of institutional and political factors affecting state capital expenditure,2003,International Journal of Public Administration,"Choudhury, E., Clingermayer, J.C., Dasse, C.M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",551
"The Index of Fiscal Decentralisation (IFD) could be a very helpful quantitative instrument while radical changes in European organisation are just now coming. The IFD permits a comparison between fifteen European countries (including Switzerland). It is based on five variables indicative of the respective weights of central and local governments: how is allocated the total amount of fiscal revenues and spending, which level has the power to determine the tax base, the tax rates and types of taxation, as well as the way they are used, what is the possibility for taxpayers to control and to take legal proceedings at different levels? The results make clear that in most of the European countries (except Switzerland) the fiscal centralisation is high, and that there is wide deviation of the index. So the prospect of a fiscal harmonisation seems to be very weak in the short term. The paper leads to the concept of “fiscal coherence”: the worst situation is that of taxation designed and collected at one level, and of spending at another one. Hence actors in the fiscal system are irresponsible and taxpayers powerless. © 2003 by Berkeley Electronic Press and IES-Europe.",index of fiscal decentralisation: methodology and findings,2003,Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines,"Price, V.C., Garello, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Few issues are more contentious for local communities than industrial pollution. When local industries pollute, lawmakers and regulators must balance two primary concerns: economic prosperity and the environment. The role of political pressure is well documented in environmental policy. What is less clear is the role jurisdictional or boundary considerations play in determining the implementation of environmental laws. Anecdotal evidence suggests that local regulators are more lenient in their treatment of polluters when the incidence of pollution falls partially on those outside the state. One explanation for such behavior is that regulators take actions to maximize political support. This paper tests this jurisdictional model using toxics release inventory (TRI) data from 1987 to 1996. We find that facilities' emissions into the air and water are systematically higher in counties that border other states. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that jurisdictional considerations are an important determinant of pollution incidence. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

"In any society characterized by diversity and specialization, each citizen - the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker - is a special interest on some dimensions of public policy and a member of the general public on many other dimensions. Each citizen enjoys being at the receiving end of special interest handouts even at the expense of inefficiencies imposed on general public. But relative to the status quo involving inefficient redistribution on most dimensions of public policy, including many dimensions on which the citizen is a member of the general public, the vast majority of citizens would surely be better off if the government did not cater to special interests at all. With this common interest in place, why do democratic societies have such a hard time ridding themselves of special interest politics? This article argues that the driving force underlying special interest politics is an information asymmetry: each citizen has a precise idea about the special interest handouts she is receiving and a vague idea about the price she is paying, as a member of the general public, for inefficient redistribution. I explain why special interest politics are ultimately impervious to reform (though we can tame them at the margin); I examine the trade-offs inherent in reform efforts (what it costs to tame them); and I spell out why special interest politics can be a Good Thing (why we should not tame them all the way even if we could).",representative government and special interest politics (we have met the enemy and he is us),2003,Journal of Theoretical Politics,"Lohmann, S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",554
"In a federal context, policies have informational value for both the voters and politicians in other jurisdictions. In the presence of self-serving biases in the perceptions of the political agents, diversity of policies may have detrimental effects. Self-serving biases can make it more difficult to reach agreements between parties. This, in turn may lead to political instability and government weakness. On the other hand, disagreement might initiate discussion among politicians and among citizens. This may, in the end, lead to more democratic (tax) policy under representative government. We offer empirical evidence (based on a survey among 683 Flemish politicians) on the existence of self-serving biases in the perceptions of politicians at the municipal level of government. Higher tax rate variability among neighbouring municipalities leads members of the ruling (opposition) parties to classify a given tax rate as lower (higher) ceteris paribus. Further, there is evidence of different reference points being used by ruling and opposition politicians: those in power use the highest of neighbour's taxes whilst the opposition refers to the lowest.",self-serving bias in tax perceptions: federalism as a source of political instability,2003,Kyklos,"Heyndels, B., Ashworth, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",555
"The literature asserts that legislators are unlikely to adopt inefficient policies unanimously. Yet the systematic and unanimous increase in quantities of Total Allowable Catch, under the auspices of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), is inefficient by internationally recognized standards. This article develops a game of distributive politics to explain this puzzle. The game is based on the assumption that specialized Council formations are composed of preference outliers and behave like ‘runway institutions’. The article shows how, over a period of 16 years, ministers were significantly less concerned with environmental protection, were more supportive of (agri-)fishery issues, and were more right-wing than their governments. The article also tests the conservationist preferences of the European Commission. Finally, we map these preferences into the policy output of the CFP and show how the Council deals with problems created by its own decisions and by national implementation through the restraining of national authorities and delegation to the Commission. © 2003, Sage Publications.

We expand Denzau and Munger's 1986 model of 'How Unorganized Interests Get Represented' to address cross-national differences in electoral systems. We look at how individual legislators allocate their efforts to serving unorganized constituents versus organized groups. Our model shows how the optimal allocation of effort is affected by differences in nominating processes and electoral rules. Our findings include the following: (1) Closed-list proportional representation (PR) makes legislators generally more responsive to interest groups and less responsive to unorganized voters than single-member districts (SMD). (2) This difference becomes smaller as the personal component of the SMD vote diminishes. (3) Legislators elected via lists in a mixed system may be even less responsive to the unorganized than legislators in a pure list system.,"a comparative theory of electoral incentives: representing the unorganized under pr, plurality and mixed-member electoral systems",2003,Journal of Theoretical Politics,"Bawn, K., Thies, M.F.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper is motivated by an important puzzle that arises from the contrasting macroeconomic experience across developing regions in the recent decades. In sharp contrast to East Asia, the fiscal policies in much of Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa are characterized by large fiscal deficits and volatilities of fiscal outcomes. In order to address both large deficits and volatile fiscal outcomes, we develop a simple model of endogenous fiscal policy in which government spending is strategically determined by heterogeneous policymakers in a dynamic game. In an economy that is highly polarized due to unequal income distribution, a larger fiscal deficit results, and the intertemporal fiscal policy path becomes more volatile. It is because the polarization of preference leads a policymaker representing each sector to spend more for her favorite sector, collectively contributing to large deficits. This polarization effect implies that a shock to tax revenue is translated into a more than proportional change in spending. Econometric evidence provides support for these predictions. Countries that have suffered from the greatest fiscal instability are those with highly polarized economic societies as measured by indicators of income inequality. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper analyzes the welfare effects of term limits for state legislators. Legislators tend to pursue their own objectives and deviate from the interests of voters as they stay longer in office. However, such long-term incumbents become more productive in transferring wealth to their constituents due to seniority they gain, and voters re-elect the incumbent. Term limits reduce the maximum seniority of a district's legislator and of other districts' legislators as well, affecting the relative seniority of the legislator. Thus, the legislator gains relative seniority sometimes and loses other times under term limits. As a consequence, voters of a district may or may not benefit from term limits.

"Vertical fiscal imbalance, decentralized responsibility of spending with centralized financing, creates a common pool problem with spending pressure towards central funds. A model of decentralized government spending under vertical fiscal imbalance is developed, and the importance of national political characteristics for internalization of costs and spending level is investigated in an econometric analysis of Norway during 1880-1990. We argue that in a parliamentary democracy, the internalization of costs is influenced by the party fragmentation of parliament. This is confirmed by the econometric analysis using a Herfindahl index as a measure of fragmentation and political strength.","spending growth with vertical fiscal imbalance: decentralized government spending in norway, 1880-1990",2002,Economics and Politics,"Borge, L.-E., Rattsø, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",567
"This paper explores on a panel of 19 OECD countries the role of fragmentation in determining fiscal outcomes over the 1970-95 period. We first define the notion of fragmentation of fiscal policy-making as the degree to which the costs of a dollar of aggregate expenditure are internalized by individual decision-makers. Empirically, this notion has two key logical components: the number of decision-makers and the rules of the game, or the budget process. In turn, the number of decision makers can refer to the number of parties in a coalition, or the number of ministers in the cabinet. We test all these determinants against each other, and against perhaps the oldest explanation of all, ideology. We show that cabinet size and, to a lesser degree, coalition size and ideology, are significant and robust determinants of fiscal outcomes. In particular, transfers are the budget items most affected by these factors. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Weingast and others have argued that working legislatures will implicitly adopt quasi-unanimity rules or conventions. We present an alternative model of distributive majoritarian politics. The distinctive feature is ""common access."" If democratic politics is modeled, not in terms of a monolithic decision structure, but instead as a setting where differing and separate decision authorities are granted access to the general taxable capacity, collective action can be analyzed in the logic of common resource usage.

"For politicians in office, reforming public sector institutions is an investment; they must spend resources now in order to achieve future gains. There are no property rights attached to these institutions. Therefore, politicians need to remain in control if they are to reap the full benefits of reform. When the probability of re-election is unaffected by the reform choice, political polarisation between incumbent and challenger results in a lower critical value for the cost of investment by reducing the benefits of reform compared to a benchmark of no uncertainty. The reduction in the cut-off rate is increasing in the degree of polarisation. However, if undertaking reforms increases this probability, the likelihood of investment might increase, the more so the greater the polarisation in preferences. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This research bridges the divide by analyzing the political and fiscal structures that are likely to account for the highly divergent economic experiences of federal systems around the world. To test these propositions, the authors use an original data set to conduct analyses of budget balance and inflation in fifteen federations around the world from 1978 through 1996. The empirical research suggests that the level of fiscal decentralization, the nature of intergovernmental finance, and vertical partisan relations all influence macroeconomic outcomes.

"Contrary to simple theoretical predictions, existing evidence suggests that federal grants do not crowd out state government spending. A legislative bargaining model with endogenous grants documents a positive correlation between grant receipts and preferences for public goods; this correlation has likely biased existing work against measuring crowd-out. To correct for such endogeneity, the model motivates instruments based on the political power of state congressional delegations. Exploiting this exogenous variation in grants, the instrumental variables estimator reports crowd-out that is statistically and economically significant. This endogeneity may explain the flypaper effect, a nonequivalence between grant receipts and private income.",endogenous federal grants and crowd-out of state government spending: theory and evidence from the federal highway aid program,2002,American Economic Review,"Knight, B.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",573
"Difficulties faced by the Economic and Monetary Union have strengthened the position of those who advocate a process of (further) political integration in the European Union (EU). A widespread fear is, though, that such a process would favor powerful interest groups able to lobby the EU policymakers. Persson and Tabellini (1994) argue that political centralization will increase the size of the government through lobbying because of free-riding incentives created by federally funded programs with localized benefits. We extend their analysis by presenting a model where the budgeting process is divided into two stages, instead of one, which better captures the EU institutional framework. A federal legislator (the Council) chooses the size of the budget at one stage, while a federal agency (the Commission) chooses the allocation of the budget at the next stage. We show that separation of powers in the budgeting process restricts free riding and, therefore, reduces the incentives to lobby. The result is an unchanged budget under centralization. Moreover, it is shown that if the lobbying activity is directed to both policymakers, competitive lobbying may actually reduce the size of the public sector under centralized policymaking.",does centralization increase the size of government? the effects of separation of powers and lobbying,2002,International Tax and Public Finance,"Mazza, I., Van Winden, F.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",574
"The Ramsey rule for optimal excise taxation suggests that goods should be taxed in inverse proportion to their elasticities of demand. This analysis shows that when the political process that determines tax rates is taken into account, the Ramsey rule may not be superior to a fiscal constitution that specifies that all goods are taxed at the same rate. The information necessary to set taxes in conformance with the Ramsey rule is not directly observable, which will lead to rent-seeking activities as interest groups try to influence the political determination of tax rates they face. Furthermore, incentives in the political process work against setting taxes according to the Ramsey rule.

"The role of institutions as determinants of rent seeking success is well established. In this paper, we focus on institutions that have received little attention in the literature, namely electoral institutions. We examine three measures of electoral institutional structure that are hypothesized to be instrumental in determining the level of rent seeking success. These are the type of electoral system, pluralistic or proportional; method of selection of the chief executive, presidential or parliamentary; and the number of electoral districts. An index of economic freedom is used as the metric for rent seeking opportunities created by governments. Theoretical implications of variation in these electoral institutions are developed. These implications are empirically tested employing data from 29 countries classified as having emerging market economies. Countries with emerging economies are expected to exhibit more institutional flexibility that more developed countries whose property rights are well established and defended. The empirical results are controlled for differences in a number of demographic and historical factors. Plurality electoral systems are more resistant to the political demands of rent seeking than proportional systems. Fewer election districts seem to reduce rent seeking opportunities However, conditional on the type of electoral system, presidential systems are found to be no more resistant to rent seeking than parliamentary systems. Finally, we find strong control effects.

"Although observers of Brazilian politics commonly hold that voters reward incumbents for ""bringing home the bacon,"" I provide reasons to question the direct link between pork and electoral success as well as statistical evidence demonstrating the lack of such a link. This generates a puzzle: if pork barreling is ineffective, why do Brazilian deputies spend so much time seeking pork? The answer is that deputies do not trade pork for votes, they trade pork for money: porkbarrel success helps incumbents raise funds from private sector interests that profit from government contracts. In turn, politicians' access to money, not pork, directly affects their electoral prospects. This article provides a new understanding of the electoral connection in Brazil by showing that existing analyses either have overestimated pork's impact or are underdetermined because they have not included measures of campaign finance. The findings should also encourage comparativists interested in perk-barrel polities, clientelism, the personal vote, and campaign behavior more generally to focus attention on the role of money in elections.",pork barreling is not credit claiming or advertising: campaign finance and the sources of the personal vote in brazil,2002,Journal of Politics,"Samuels, D.J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article uses cross-national data to examine the effects of fiscal and political institutions on the fiscal performance of subnational governments. Long-term balanced budgets among subnational governments are found when either (1) the center imposes borrowing restrictions or (2) subnational governments have both wide-ranging taxing and borrowing autonomy. Large and persistent aggregate deficits occur when subnational governments are simultaneously dependent on intergovernmental transfers and free to borrow- a combination found most frequently among constituent units in federations. Time-series cross-section analysis reveals that as countries increase their reliance on intergovernmental transfers over time, subnational and overall fiscal performance decline, especially when subnational governments have easy access to credit. These findings illuminate a key dilemma of fiscal federalism and a more precise notion of its dangers: When constitutionally or politically constrained central governments take on heavy cofinancing obligations, they often cannot credibly commit to ignore the fiscal problems of lower-level governments.",the dilemma of fiscal federalism: grants and fiscal performance around the world,2002,American Journal of Political Science,"Rodden, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",580
"Recent research has uncovered a majority party advantage in the allocation of federal resources, a relationship seemingly at odds with the bipartisan support often enjoyed by distributive policies and programs. We reconcile this disjuncture by developing a partisan blame avoidance account of the distribution of legislative park. According to this account, the majority party inoculates itself against minority party charges of wasteful spending by including the minority in park barrel coalitions. At the same time, the majority party, mindful of the electoral benefits of bringing home the bacon, reserves the most valuable awards for its members. We assess this account by examining the awarding of appropriations earmarks to institutions of higher education between 1995 and 2000.

"Observed fiscal policy varies greatly across time and countries. How can we explain this variation? This paper surveys the recent literature that has tried to answer this question. We adopt a unified approach in portraying public policy as the equilibrium outcome of an explicitly specified political process. We divide the material into three parts. In Part I, we focus on median-voter equilibria that apply to policy issues where disagreement between voters is likely to be one-dimensional. We thus study the general redistributive programs, typical of the modern welfare state: redistribution between rich and poor, young and old, employed and unemployed, and labor and capital. In Part II we study special-interest politics. Here, the policy problem is multi-dimensional and we focus on specific political mechanisms: we study legislative bargaining, lobbying, and electoral competition, as well as the possible interactions between these different forms of political activity. Finally, in Part III we deal with ""comparative politics"", namely policy choice under alternative political constitutions. Here, we model the rationale for separation of powers; we also contrast stylized features of majoritarian and proportional electoral rules, as well as congressional and parliamentary political regimes, focusing on their implications for rent extraction by politicians, redistribution and public goods provision. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.",chapter 24 political economics and public finance,2002,Handbook of Public Economics,"Persson, T., Tabellini, G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Political representation in the national assemblies is geographic and elected representatives care about who gains and who loses in their electoral districts. Since legislators are re-election oriented, their chances of electoral success are directly associated with the net benefits delivered to their constituents. In this perspective, geography is not only the basis for political organisation and representation, but also the hallmark of distributive politics. In this context, it is likely that locally elected politicians and party leaders standing in national elections would tend to cooperate in pre-election dates. In this paper we argue that local administrators have an incentive to manipulate local government outlays in connection with national election dates to enhance the re-election prospects of their national party leaders. In particular, given the matching character of national grants with local investment spending, we expect that in pre-election dates local policy-makers would be induced to raise investment outlays beyond their standard growth rate. This would determine inefficient local public spending as a result of the geographically-based system of democratic representation. The case study under our investigation is the behaviour of Italian local policy-makers in connection with national election dates.",local pork-barrel politics in national pre-election dates: the case of italy,2001,Public Choice,"Limosani, M., Navarra, P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Tax structures amongst OECD countries have become more uniform in the recent past (1965-1995) but it is less clear that this convergence satisfies time-series requirements. Evidence on stochastic convergence tends to suggest that there is evidence of persistence of shocks remaining over a considerable time period. A consideration of the countries where this persistence is most prevalent shows that there is significant correlation between high persistence and weak (coalition) governments, giving further weight to the theories of weak government.",political fragmentation and the evolution of national tax structures in the oecd,2001,International Tax and Public Finance,"Ashworth, J., Heyndels, B.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Models of inefficient political failure have been criticized for implicitly assuming the irrationality of voters (Wittman, 1989, 1995, 1999; Coate and Morris, 1995). Building on Caplan's (1999a, 1999b) model of ""rational irrationality"", the current paper maintains that the assumption of voter irrationality is both theoretically and empirically plausible. It then examines microfoundational criticisms of four classes of political failure models: rent-seeking, pork-barrel politics, bureaucracy, and economic reform. In each of the four cases, incorporating simple forms of privately costless irrationality makes it possible to clearly derive the models' standard conclusions. Moreover, it follows that efforts to mitigate political failures will be socially suboptimal, as most of the literature implicitly assumes.

"Although some countries have managed to obtain balanced budgets or even budget surpluses in recent times, public debts of many OECD countries remain at high levels. Since structural reforms of public spending have only infrequently taken place in most countries, fiscal pressure will increase again in the future due to society's ageing and the accompanying increases in social transfer spending. Constitutional restrictions on debt levels and legal rules of the budgetary process, such as a strong role of the minister of finance, are supposed to be helping against the debt bias inherent in political decision-making procedures.

"This article explores the benefits and costs of the voter initiative, a direct democracy device that allows policy decisions to be made by voters rather than their elected representatives. Previous research suggests that by introducing ""competition"" into the proposal process, the initiative leads to policies that are closer to the median voter's ideal point. In our model, in contrast, the effect of the initiative is conditional on the severity of representative agency problems and uncertainty about voter preferences. The initiative always makes the voter better off when representatives are faithful agents, but when voter preferences are uncertain, initiatives can cause ""shirking"" representatives to choose policies farther from the voter's ideal point. Our evidence shows that initiatives are more common in states with heterogeneous populations, and initiatives reduce state spending when Democrats control the government and when citizens have diverse preferences.",political resource allocation: benefits and costs of voter initiatives,2001,"Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization","Matsusaka, J.G., McCarty, N.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Politicians who care about the spoils of office may underprovide a public good because its benefits cannot be targeted to voters as easily as pork-barrel spending.

In a winner-take-all system the public good is provided less often than in a proportional system when the public good is particularly desirable.

"This paper explores the determinants of federal grants allocation across provincial states in Argentina. Our analysis suggests that the redistributive pattern implicit in the federal system of intergovernmental grants cannot be explained on normative grounds exclusively. In order to understand the rationale behind federal grants distribution, a positive approach could render better results. Specifically, we claim that the distribution of federal grants could be associated with political variables such as the political representation of jurisdictions at Congress. The econometric analysis suggests that the significant disparity observed in the per capita representation across different provinces is an important factor explaining the allocation of those transfers. In this respect, overrepresented provinces, both at the senate and at the lower chamber, have received, on average, higher resources from the national government compared to more populous and less represented states.

"The growing importance of local and provincial governments as providers of public services and the importance of those services for the overall performance of the national economy has led to a careful re-examination of how public resources are allocated by decentralized governments. While the Tiebout model promises efficient local resource allocations, the conditions necessary for such outcomes - many local governments, fully informed and costlessly mobile households, no spillovers, residential head taxes - are rarely met in practice. Lacking a sufficient number of competitive local governments, however, other institutional safeguards must be found. Four such institutions are identified here. First, a stable central government managed by nationally elected political parties or presidents capable of making (second-best) efficient interpersonal redistributions of income while at the same time denying inefficient intergovernmental transfers and/or access to non-resident taxation. Second, a mature banking system and fully integrated national capital markets to minimize the economic consequences of a single government's failure to repay its local debts. Third, informed and sophisticated municipal bond and local land markets capable of evaluating local services and finances so as to shift back onto local residents the full economic consequences of inefficient local government fiscal choices. Fourth, a politically independent judiciary capable of enforcing constitutional rules for spending and tax assignment, local debt repayment, and balanced local budgets.

Some empirical contributions have already answered affirmatively; here we consider whether it is possible to do better by looking not at the type of government in charge (single party vs. coalition), but at its nature. We distinguish between homogeneous and non-homogeneous governments: the latter are held together only by extra-economic motives, while in the former there is also a common view on economic policy, as is the case not just with single party, but also with a number of coalition governments. By using cluster analysis on data regarding 11 OECD countries from 1962 to 1992 we come to the conclusion that classifying governments by nature makes more sense, as it isolates those coalitions where a strategic interaction over fiscal policy takes place between partners. Ideological coalitions have a greater probability to be associated with strong positive fiscal impulses, but also with strong negative ones. We argue this is not in contrast with the conclusions of the Alesina and Drazen model (1991).",i governi di coalizione sono tutti «fiscally irresponsible»? un'indagine empirica con l'utilizzo della cluster analysis,2000,Politica Economica,"Nogare, C.D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We posit that the fiscal behavior of Argentine provinces is determined by a common pool game at two levels: within each province, and across political units. In the latter game, the national government has a greater incentive than the provincial governments to internalize the negative externality of fiscal imprudence. Given relatively strong party discipline, the president is able to induce governors from his party to internalize a portion of the externality to a greater extent than opposition governors. In Argentina 'party matters' for fiscal behavior, but it does so for reasons different from those identified in studies of OECD countries. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

"This paper investigates the effect of recent reforms of budgetary institutions in Uganda and Zambia. We argue that cash budgeting has brought clear benefits in terms of improved expenditure control with regard to line ministries. Contrary to what is often suggested, however, adoption of a cash budget has not provided a means for top politicians in either country to ""tie their hands"" with respect to intervention in fiscal policy decisions. In Uganda improved fiscal policy outcomes have, in fact, been achieved as a result of (and not in spite of) discretionary interventions by top politicians. In Zambia, a strict rule imposing a balanced budget on a monthly basis has proven partially effective, due in no small part to International Monetary Fund (IMF) enforcement, but costly in terms of increased volatility of expenditures.

"This article explores determinants of elderly migration in the United States by extending the more formal model developed by Conway and Houtenville (1998) instead of the more traditional ""investment"" model. The approach is twofold. In the authors ' model, they clarify the publicly provided goods that generate utility for the elderly while recognizing that the tax burden of the elderly is for all publicly provided goods supplied by each state. They also include the effects of growth rates in economic and policy variables during the migration period, which allows them to measure the endogeneity of elderly net in-migration and state expenditure policy. This approach generates intriguing results. In addition to the significance of standard amenity variables, the authors find that state per capita income and the real growth rate of state per capita income have a significant and positive effect on elderly net in-migration. They also find significant effects of overall tax burden variables. Surprisingly, when state elderly net in-migration and state fiscal policy are modeled endogenously, there is little evidence of any general effect of state expenditures on elderly migration.",elderly internal migration in the united states revisited,2000,Public Finance Review,"Gale, L.R., Heath, W.C.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

To do so, we develop a model of vote trading with an endogenous voting rule and coalition formation process. We find that in equilibrium, legislative chambers will almost never choose institutions that guarantee either simple majorities or universalistic outcomes. Rather, coalition sizes from minimal winning to universalistic will be possible under certain conditions given the choice of voting rule.

This setup has striking macroeconomic implications.

"It is often argued that executive powers such as the veto serve to reduce particularistic spending by the legislature. I argue that the effect of the executive veto depends strongly on assumptions about both the nature of executive preferences and the institutional structure of executive-legislative bargaining. To support these claims, I develop a model of distributive policymaking subject to an executive veto. This framework incorporates variation in presidential objectives and formal powers into a dynamic bargaining model. In equilibrium, stronger veto power leads to a lower level of distributive spending, but the effects are mitigated to the extent that the president prefers spending in some districts over others. The model also generates new insights and predictions about fiscal policy under the separation of powers, including the effects of divided government, electoral rules, and term limitations for the executive.",presidential pork: executive veto power and distributive politics,2000,American Political Science Review,"McCarty, N.M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",609
"Fiscal decentralization consists primarily of devolving revenue sources and expenditure functions to lower tiers of government. By bringing the government closer to the people, fiscal decentralization is expected to boost public sector efficiency, as well as accountability and transparency in service delivery and policy-making. Decentralization also entails greater complexity in intergovernmental fiscal relations, and coordination failures in fiscal relations are likely to have a bearing on fiscal positions, nationally and subnationally. Evidence provided in this paper for a sample of 30 countries suggests that coordination failures in intergovernmental fiscal relations are likely to result in a deficit bias in decentralized policy-making, particularly in the case of developing countries, which may not meet important requirements for successful decentralization.

"Despite evidence that modern democracies systematically shortchange public investment goods, relatively little theoretical work exists to explain this phenomenon. We build on Baron and Ferejohn's (American Political Science Review, 83(4) (1989) 1181-1206) bargaining model to describe public investments in a setting of budgetary politics. Specifically, we show that underinvestment inherently arises from distributive politics within a majoritarian institution. The inability of current majorities to contract with future ones drives a wedge between spending on consumption today and investing for future consumption. Extensions to the model demonstrate that earmarking future returns to specific players and/or detaching consumption from investment decisions yields more efficient levels of public investment.",majority-rule bargaining and the under provision of public investment goods,2000,Journal of Public Economics,"Leblanc, W., Snyder Jr., J.M., Tripathi, M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",611
"In the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (“RTAA”), Congress delegated its constitutionally granted power to set tariffs to the President. Trade agreements negotiated under the RTAA required no ex post congressional approval. Instead, the broad authority conferred upon the President was subject to congressional renewal every three years. Tariff reductions also were no longer made unilaterally via omnibus tariff legislation, but rather bilaterally via trade agreements and in exchange for comparable tariff reductions from foreign trading partners. The RTAA dramatically altered the governance structure that had controlled U.S. trade policymaking for over a century, laying a new institutional foundation that made U.S. postwar participation in, and leadership of, global trade liberalization and expansion possible. Indeed, the RTAA is arguably the most important piece of trade legislation of this century. It also is an unusual case of congressional delegation of policymaking authority to the President. Representative Hamilton Fish (R-N.Y.) called the RTAA “a betrayal of our representative form of government [that] amounts to an open admission by Congress that … it is now incompetent and unfit to legislate properly, intelligently and in the public interest.” The press described the RTAA as a “radical departure in commercial policy.” What accounts for this extraordinary delegation, especially by a legislative body better known for guarding its power than for giving it away?

"Do political and fiscal decentralization make it easier or harder to control inflation? Statistical analysis of average annual inflation rates in a panel of 87 countries in the 1970s and 1980s found no clear relationship between decentralization and the level of inflation. Political decentralization, however, does appear to reduce change in countries' relative inflation rates over time. By creating additional veto players, federal structure may ""lock in"" existing patterns of monetary policy - whether inflationary or strict. Among the (mostly developed) countries that started with low inflation, inflation tended to increase more slowly in federations than in unitary states. Among the (mostly developing) countries that started with high inflation, inflation tended to increase faster in the federations. There is evidence that political decentralization locks in a country's degree of practical central bank independence - whether high or low - and the relative hardness or softness of budget constraints on subnational governments.","decentralization and inflation: commitment, collective action, or continuity?",2000,American Political Science Review,"Treisman, D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Political culture in Switzerland is, to a large extent, influenced by its direct democracy. Compared to purely representative systems, direct democracy leads to a different type of communication among citizens and also between citizens and representatives.

Because citizens are better informed, politicians have less leeway to pursue their personal interests.

"This paper investigates how changes in both institutional incentives and economic interests are important for securing durable changes in economic policy. We study how bipartisan support developed to sustain the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) of 1934, which fundamentally transformed U.S. trade policy. The durability of this change was achieved only when the Republicans, long-time supporters of high tariffs who originally vowed to repeal the RTAA, began to support this Democratic initiative in the 1940s. We find little evidence of an ideological shift among Republicans, but rather an increased sensitivity to export interests for which the institutional structure of the RTAA itself may have been responsible. We conclude that the combination of greater export opportunities and the institutional change that strengthened exporters' lobbying position was required to bring about Republican support for trade liberalization.","interests, institutions, and ideology in securing policy change: the republican conversion to trade liberalization after smoot-hawley",1999,Journal of Law and Economics,"Irwin, D.A., Kroszner, R.S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The determinants of school spending are investigated using a disaggregated demand model augmented to include political factors. High school spending by county governments is disaggregated to identify the sources of variation in teacher-student ratio, non-wage spending per student, and student enrollment. The disaggregation throws new light on the role of cost factors in explaining the expansion of educational services. High school spending is shown to be highly inelastic to county revenue and major cost factors. The spending decision is analyzed as an example of the common pool problem in distributive politics. Schools offer benefits to each municipality, and municipalities fight for new schools since the costs are shared. The political decision implies a balancing between this spending pressure and the coordinated interests of the county. Political strength, measured by the party fragmentation of the council, is shown to hold down costs and allow for more student enrollment. On the other hand, the spending pressure measured by the average size of the municipalities in the county, influences all three spending components, and the effects depend on the political strength.",local public choice of school spending: disaggregating the demand function for educational services,1999,Economics of Education Review,"Falch, T., Rattsø, J.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",618
"The provision of public services through national legislatures gives legislators the chance to fund locally beneficial public projects using a shared national tax base. Nationally financed and provided local (congestible) public goods will be purchased at a subsidized price below marginal cost and may be inefficiently too large as a consequence. An important assumption behind this inefficiency is that national legislators in fact demand more of the locally beneficial project as the local price for projects declines. This paper provides the first direct test of this important assumption using legislators' project choices following the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA'86). We find legislators' chosen water project sizes do fall as the local cost share rises, with a price elasticity of demand ranging from -0.81 for flood control and shoreline protection projects to -2.55 for large navigation projects. The requirement of WRDA'86 that local taxpayers contribute a greater share to the funding of local water projects reduced overall proposed project spending in our sample by 35% and the federal outlay for proposed project spending by 48%.",changing the price of pork: the impact of local cost sharing on legislators' demands for distributive public goods,1999,Journal of Public Economics,"DelRossi, A.F., Inman, R.P.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",619

"Congress uses varying degrees of specificity when passing legislation. Sometimes it writes very detailed, exacting laws; other times it leaves these details to implementing agencies. A natural positive question then arises: what factors are critical for understanding the degree of delegation used by Congress in a particular circumstance? This paper exploits the tradeoff between the distributive and informational effects of organizational design to examine congressional delegation. We argue that variations in the relative preferences of committee, floor (congressional median voter), and executive actors cause a rational floor voter to choose different forms of collective decision making. We find that homogeneity of committee-floor preferences leads to less delegation, while preference homogeneity between Congress and the executive leads to more delegation. We also argue that delegation emerges when actors are more risk averse or when the uncertainty characterizing the collective choice environment is large. We develop our logic using a game theoretic model of the policy-making process and draw out the empirical implications of our approach.","asymmetric information, delegation, and the structure of policy-making",1999,Journal of Theoretical Politics,"Epstein, D., O'Halloran, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) of 1934 has long been heralded as a simple institutional reform with revolutionary consequences: namely, by changing the trade policymaking process in the United States, the RTAA is held responsible for the dramatic liberalization in U.S. policy beginning in the 1930s and 1940s. This article takes issue with this conventional wisdom. I argue that the standard accounts - which emphasize the importance of delegation for overcoming logrolling in Congress or for facilitating reciprocity in international trade negotiations - fail to provide an adequate explanation for just how the institutional innovation was achieved and sustained in the face of protectionist opposition. I suggest instead that trade liberalization was driven by exogenous changes in party constituencies and societal preferences that had crucial effects on congressional votes to extend the RTAA authority and liberalize trade after 1945. The preservation of the RTAA program was symptomatic rather than causal; as a consequence, it may well be abandoned in the future. The evolution of U.S. trade policy has been, and will continue to be, powerfully shaped by changes in the preferences of societal groups and in the positions taken by parties on the trade issue.","the magic bullet? the rtaa, institutional reform, and trade liberalization",1999,International Organization,"Hiscox, M.J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper develops a model of the effects of electoral incentives on policy, then applies the model to the New Deal realignment. In the model, policy is the outcome of an agenda-setter game between the president and legislators. Specifically, the president sets policy subject to legislative approval. The president's ability to concentrate benefits in states with high electoral payoffs depends in part on his or her power to influence legislators' prospects for reelection. Regression analysis shows that New Deal spending and roll call voting patterns in the House of Representatives support the model. Historical accounts of other aspects of New Deal policy, including labor and civil rights issues, are consistent with the model. Together, the theoretical results and the empirical evidence help to explain several striking features of the policy and politics of the 1930s, including (i) why a government dominated by the Democratic Party would provide high benefits to swing states and much lower benefits to the traditionally Democratic South, (ii) why favoritism of swing states increased from the 1933-1934 period to the 1937-1938 period, (iii) why favoritism of swing states decreased from 1938 to 1939, and (iv) why, with the rise of the conservative coalition in Congress in the late 1930s, it was the representatives from traditionally loyal Democratic districts that created the strongest Democratic opposition to Roosevelt and the New Deal.","electoral incentives, public policy, and the new deal realignment",1999,Southern Economic Journal,"Fleck, R.K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In order to understand how electoral rules affect political outcomes, we need to know whether and how voters react to them. The ability of voters to react strategically to electoral rules may be limited in cases where the electoral rules are complex. In this article, I look for evidence of rational reactions to a moderately complex electoral system, that used in the Federal Republic of Germany. By examining district-level election results, I find substantial evidence that voters do react rationally, despite the complexity of the two-vote system. The rational reactions by voters lead to excess first votes for incumbents, for candidates of the major party expected to be in government, to major-party candidates in close races and to major-party candidates in districts with significant minority-party support. The findings support both the general claim that voters can react strategically to complex electoral rules, and more specific claims about the value of the two-vote ballot in Germany.","voter responses to electoral complexity: ticket splitting, rational voters and representation in the federal republic of germany",1999,British Journal of Political Science,"Bawn, K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

The 16th amendment provided the financing for government to expand its scope, and the 17th amendment created more democratic accountability, which both were goals of the Progressive movement.

"Government subsidies sparked the onset of the railway age in nineteenth-century Brazil. Guaranteed dividends attracted railway investment, while rate regulation worked to capture for the consumers of transport services a large share of the railways' gains. All the major guaranteed railways generated high social rates of return for Brazil. The bulk of the benefits created by railway investment accrued to Brazilians rather than shareholders overseas. Rate regulation by the government succeeded in distributing the surplus away from foreign-owned railways. Both freight rates and profits were closely related to the nationality of ownership, revealing politics as a key determinant of the magnitude and distribution of the surplus that the subsidized railway projects created.","market intervention in a backward economy: railway subsidy in brazil, 1854-1913",1998,Economic History Review,"Summerhill, W.R.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The purpose of this article is to discuss the institutional aspects of regional integration and its implication for the determination of external trade policies by a trade bloc. In particular, this study raises the question, can institutional designs in a regional integration area increase the responsiveness of trade authorities to protectionist demands? Contrary to some previous research, the analysis shows that the answer is affirmative. As illustrated by the European Union (EU) experience, the supply of trade protection in the context of regional integration crucially depends on the design and evolution of institutions adopted by the trade bloc. Moreover, the dynamic process of regional integration entails a redefinition of rules which inevitably attracts lobbying activities (in particular from those with protectionist interests). In consequence, in the absence of a strong political commitment, the danger exists that the design of new institutions will be captured by protectionist forces.",political economy considerations on the supply of trade protection in regional integration agreements,1998,Journal of Common Market Studies,"Bilal, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Economists and political scientists have long debated the socially optimal proportion of a collective decision-making body whose consent should be required in order to reach a decision. In their classic contribution to this debate, Buchanan and Tullock [Buchanan, J.M., Tullock, G., 1962. The Calculus of Consent. Univ. of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor] argued that, in the absence of what they called 'decision-making costs', the unanimity rule is socially optimal. The present paper shows that their approach actually leads to the conclusion that the unanimity rule is (almost always) suboptimal. In contrast, simple majority rule - the rule most commonly observed in collective decisions - is found to be socially optimal under plausible conditions.",unanimity and majority rule: the calculus of consent reconsidered,1998,European Journal of Political Economy,"Guttman, J.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Improvements in the efficient allocation of resources can be reached by increasing public revenue and expenditure visibility. This paper presents some indicators permitting the making of time and space fiscal visibility measurements and comparisons and advances new systematic estimates on fiscal visibility for systems and subsystems of public revenue now in force in the European Union member countries. Policy implications seem straightforward for these countries as present revenue visibility values are low in general. Allocation improvements could be obtained by implementing changes and reforms aiming to raise values of public revenue visibility and to make domestic fiscal systems and subsystems converge to the highest values.

"The possibility that the benefits of lobbying may spill over to other members of society is incorporated into an endogenous growth framework to show that an increase in lobbying may improve welfare and growth even when motivated by self-interest. This case arises when the social benefits of such spillovers dominate the adverse effects of lobbying (e.g., more taxes to pay for policies). In general, however, the decentralized economy grows less than is socially desirable as agents lobby either too much or too little. Rent seeking is a special case of overlobbying where spillovers are absent and, thus, agents always overlobby from a social point of view. Also, the decentralized economy's propensity to lobby increases with the share of public investments in national income.","growth, lobbying and public goods",1998,European Journal of Political Economy,"Mohtadi, H., Roe, T.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

" A great deal of research has been done on the boundary between economics
 and political science in the last five to ten years. This research in 'political
 economics' spans many subfields, such as macroeconomics, trade, public
 finance, regulation, rational choice politics, and game theory. A common
 denominator has been to study structural models of the political process: agents
 behave rationally within well-specified economic and political institutions,
 where the policymaking process is formulated as an extensive form game.
 Methodologically, much progress has been made relative to traditional ap-
 proaches, which were often based on inconsistent or irrational political and
 economic behaviour, relying on non-derived influence functions, political
 support functions, or vote functions. Yet, the modem work has largely
 developed separately in each subfield, without much contact with other
 subfields. And each of the resulting literatures tends to focus on a distinct, but
 partial, aspect of the political process. In this lecture, I shall argue that even
 though the progress to date has been substantial, we can gain a better under-
 standing of policymaking in democracies by combining the insights from
 different strands of thinking.",economic policy and special interest politics,1998,Economic Journal,"Persson, T.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Political decisions are often biased in favor of special interests at the expense of the general public, and they are frequently inefficient in the sense that the losses incurred by the majority exceed the gains enjoyed by the minority. This article explains the bias in terms of information asymmetries and the free-rider problem. First, incumbents increase their reelection prospects by biasing policy toward groups that are better able to monitor their activities. Second, because smaller groups are better able to overcome the free-rider problem of costly monitoring, policy will be biased in their favor. Third, the effect of asymmetric monitoring on voter welfare is ambiguous. The inefficiencies created by the policy bias are offset by a positively valued selection bias: Incumbents of above-average quality are more likely to survive voter scrutiny than are low-quality types.",an information rationale for the power of special interests,1998,American Political Science Review,"Lohmann, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The literature on the organization of the United States Congress has been dominated by ""distributive"" and ""informational"" theory. One important source of disagreement between these two theories is their characterization of whether individual legislators can engage in pork-barrel activities. Here we provide evidence which indicates that the pork-barrel is alive and well in the contemporary United States Congress. We focus on whether members of power and constituency committees can direct disproportionate federal expenditures to their districts. Finding strong and systematic evidence of pork-barrel activities by committee members provides empirical support for distributive theories of legislative organization.",congressional committees and the political economy of federal outlays,1997,Public Choice,"Alvarez, R.M., Saving, J.L.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper poses a deceptively simple question. It asks, how can a program or group of programs that provides distributive benefits to recipients in a minority of legislative districts be passed by a majority of a legislative body? The answer in the existing body of work on distributive policymaking would suggest that supporters of narrowly focused programs are able to ensure passage of their pet projects by logrolling with other legislators. We argue that logrolling is not always necessary to produce majority support for narrowly focused programs. The paper considers three institutional mechanisms for building majority support for sub-majority benefit distributions: political parties, interest groups, and administrative agencies. The conditions that would be required for each mechanism to be employed are outlined. Descriptive data from the 100th Congress are employed to reflect on the relative plausibility of each of the mechanisms with respect to the question of how a program that provides distributive benefits to recipients in a minority of legislative districts can be passed by a majority of a legislative body. We reject the first mechanism - the party-based explanation -on the grounds that it is empirically implausible, at least in the American case.

We conclude that the traditional distinction between public interest theories and special interest theories has lost validity due to the entiy of game theory and institutional research.

" Analyses of the strategic considerations of international conflict identify a major obstacle to co-
 operation. Suppose, for example, that cooperation between two nations takes the form of disarma-
 ment. Although cooperation is by design the ex ante optimal policy, when the two nations make
 their arming decisions simultaneously given the policy of the other nation each has an incentive
 to deviate from the cooperative policy by arming. Since cooperation is not incentive compatible,
 it is not credible.1 The lack of credibility, in turn, calls into question the feasibility of coopera-
 tion in equilibrium.2 This paper analyzes a complementary incentive compatibility problem which

"This article examines how institutional arrangements affect the size, allocation, and use of public expenditures. It identifies a set of arrangements that can address underlying problems and affect three levels of expenditure outcomes -aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic prioritization, and technical efficiency in the use of resources. A diagnostic questionnaire is constructed which produces index values for each arrangement. This methodology is used to analyze the radical reforms introduced by New Zealand and Australia. The results show that New Zealand sought to achieve aggregate fiscal discipline and enhance technical efficiency through formal mechanisms for transparency and accountability. The Australian reforms sought to improve strategic prioritization through transparency of the medium-term costs of competing policies, and the devolution of detailed program decisions to line ministries within hard budgets.",evaluating public expenditure management systems: an experimental methodology with an application to the australia and new zealand reforms,1997,Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,"Campos, J.E., Pradhan, S.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",646
"While it is widely believed by academics, politicians, and the popular press that incumbent members of Congress are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district, the empirical evidence supporting that claim is extremely weak. One explanation for the failure to uncover the expected relationship between federal spending and election outcomes is that incumbents who expect to have difficulty being reelected are likely to exert greater effort in obtaining federal outlays. Since it is generally impossible to adequately measure this effort, the estimated impact of spending is biased downward because of an omitted variable bias. We address this estimation problem using instrumental variables. For each House district, we use spending outside the district but inside the state containing the district as an instrument for spending in the district. Federal spending is affected by a large number of actors (e.g., governors, senators, mayors, and other House members in the state delegation), leading to positive correlations in federal spending across the House districts within states. However, federal spending outside of a district is unlikely to be strongly correlated with the strength of that district's electoral challenge. In contrast to previous studies, we find strong evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents: an additional $100 per capita in spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote. The only category of federal spending that does not appear to yield electoral rewards is direct transfers to individuals.",the impact of federal spending on house election outcomes,1997,Journal of Political Economy,"Levitt, S.D., Snyder Jr., J.M.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",647
"This article examines the relationship between demographic structure and the level of government spending on K-12 education. Panel data for the states of the United States over the 1960-1990 period suggests that an increase in the fraction of elderly residents in a jurisdiction is associated with a significant reduction in per-child educational spending. This reduction is particularly large when the elderly residents and the school-age population are from different racial groups. Variation in the size of the school-age population does not result in proportionate changes in education spending, thus, students in states with larger school-age populations receive lower per-student spending than those in states with smaller numbers of potential students. These results provide support for models of generational competition in the allocation of public sector resources. They also suggest that the effect of cohort size on government-mediated transfers must be considered in analyzing how cohort size affects economic well-being.",demographic structure and the political economy of public education,1997,Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,"Poterba, J.M.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In a developing legislature, two types of stability are crucial for maintaining institutional viability. The first type of stability identifies legislative proposals that are invulnerable to majority rule voting cycles. The research addressing the implications of majority rule voting cycles has been rich and sustained, allowing scholars to address committee structures of institutionalized legislatures and norms. However, many formal theories of modern legislatures are not readily applicable to less structurally developed legislatures.

"In this study, we examine the extent to which legislators receive electoral benefits from altering the geographic distribution of federal outlays. Although there are both theoretical and anecdotal reasons to believe in the existence of such benefits, previous empirical work has largely failed to verify the connection between pork barreling and reelection. We examine House incumbents during the 1980s, when budget deficits were allegedly forcing legislators to end the acquisition of distributive benefits, and we discover that legislators did in fact reap electoral benefits from pork barreling in the 1980s. We further discover that there is a sharp partisan difference in the marginal effects of federal outlays: additional federal monies strongly affect Democratic reelection margins but barely impact the electoral fortunes of Republicans. This conclusion has important implications for current debates about Congress, divided government, and the recent Republican takeover of Congress.","deficits, democrats, and distributive benefits: congressional elections and the pork barrel in the 1980s",1997,Political Research Quarterly,"Alvarez, R.M., Saving, J.L.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In this journal, McChesney engaged Lewin and Trumbell in a debate concerning the reasons why criminal ""gains"" are excluded in a cost-benefit analysis of investment in maintaining law and order.1 Theft might be perceived as a mechanism for transferring property (so that loss to victims appears offset by ""gain"" to criminals). However, criminal ""gains"" can be excluded from CBA simply on the grounds that they arise from illicit activity or, following McChesney, because the ""gains"" are offset, in total, by the rent-seeking costs involved in securing the transfer.2 The appropriate rationale remains an issue of debate, but the debate is one that has broader currency than has been noted to date. In this paper McChesney's argument is extended to explain why legitimate ""gains"" from public sector investment are typically ignored in CBA. Public choice literature identifies the different ways in which actors in the political process acquire rents at the expense of voter-taxpayers.3 For example, public spending may increase salary and improve working conditions of bureaucrats4 or it may enhance politicians' career prospects.5 Such gains are excluded from a CBA although they need not be illicit. The questions posed in the following sections of this paper are: (1) Why is this so? (2) Can all of such ""gains"" be excluded? and (3) Is there a case for constructing a CBA (or ""political"" CBA) that would include them?","legitimate and illegitimate transfers: dealing with ""political"" cost-benefit analysis",1996,International Review of Law and Economics,"Jones, P., Cullis, J.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper investigates the determinants of state spending over 1960—1990. Recent empirical studies suggest that state government expenditure is greater than the electorate desires. Our main finding is that expenditure was positively related to the number of seats in a state's legislature. This is consistent with the hypothesis that logrolling leads representatives to spend more than their constituents would like. We also find that political parties do not have a pronounced effect on overall levels of expenditure, but do influence the composition of spending. In particular, Democratic control of state government is associated with higher levels of welfare spending. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Increased electoral safety weakens the political constraint against deficit finance because the only electoral check on deficit finance occurs when representatives run for reelection.

Our explanation for the resilience and durability of these subsystems is based on the argument that the key actors in the subsystem adopt strategies that are mutually supportive of each other’s needs and provide protection for the entire subsystem during periods of retrenchment. The thesis developed in this article focuses in particular on the role that agencies play in building and maintaining strong subsystem relationships. We argue that agencies pursue two main objectives to help reinforce subsystem relationships: (1) the maximization of the number of congressional districts that are benefited by the portfolio of programs administered by the agency and (2) the minimization of the collective action problems of the interest groups whose members benefit from their programs. Preliminary data relating to these arguments are presented for the 1983-1989 period. We find evidence that agencies that provide financial assistance to a limited number of congressional districts have attempted, with modest success, to increase the number of districts in which they provide assistance. We find strong evidence that agencies have attempted to reduce collective actions of their supporting interest groups by reducing the within-program diversity of the recipients benefiting from the portfolio of programs administered by the agency. We conclude that these strategies were instrumental in helping domestic agencies survive, and in some cases grow, during the 1980s. © 1994, Sage Publications.

" The late 1970s and 1980s witnessed a host of theoretical models of distrib-
 utive politics-the politics of expenditure programs where the benefits can be targeted
 to specific localities, paid for via general revenues. One of the main hypotheses
 of this literature concerns universalism, the notion that distributive politics should
 reflect coalitions of near-unanimous size rather than coalitions of narrower or
 minimal winning size.' Another is that distributive programs organized by strong
 parties are likely to exhibit greater efficiency (Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981;

"If different parties control the U.S. Congress and White House, the United States may maintain higher import protection than otherwise. This proposition follows from a distributive politics model in which Congress can choose to delegate trade policymaking to the President. When the congressional majority party faces a President of the other party, the former has an incentive to delegate to but to constrain the President by requiring congressional approval of trade proposals by up-or-down vote. This constraint forces the President to provide higher protection in order to assemble a congressional majority. Evidence confirms that (1) the institutional constraints placed on the President's trade policymaking authority are strengthened in times of divided government and loosened under unified government and (2) U.S. trade policy was significantly more protectionist under divided than under unified government during the period 1949–90.",divided government and u.s. trade policy: theory and evidence,1994,International Organization,"Lohmann, S., O’ Halloran, S.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Among the quirks of Congress that have exercised scholars, one of the most puzzling is universalism, the tendency of distributive legislation to command unanimous or near unanimous majorities.1 Such legislation uses general revenues to finance water projects, rent subsides, school construction, or other separate benefits for the constituencies of the winning majority to bake a pie and distribute slices to the bakers' households. Unanimity on any issue would be remarkable enough: in the House, the unanimous majority is one of 2434 possible majorities, and those of 90 percent or more are fewer than 4.10-17 of that total. Winning majorities are not random, of course. Often they are partisan (Weisberg, 1978), as well they might be in a body elected and organized by party label. Yet the majority party embraces the opposition on distributive issues. When not acting as party animals, congressmen sometimes form regional, sectoral, and other cross-cutting coalitions (Schattschneider, 1942), which they can expand by vote trading. Once a majority is reached, however, there is no evident reason to keep expanding. Occasionally, I like to think, congressmen act as Burkean trustees, sacrificing partisan and parochial interests for the wider public interest. Then one might expect unanimity or something close, but not distributive legislation. More frequently, perhaps, congressmen act as Burkean delegates, promoting the interests of their several constituencies (Mayhew, 1974), party and public be damned. Then one expects a bounty of distributive legislation, but nothing like unanimity. Then, predicts Riker's Size Principle, distributive issues should be decided by particularly small majorities: each of few households can'have a bigger slice of pie than each of many.",representation as agency and the pork barrel paradox,1994,Public Choice,"Schwartz, T.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",668
"A recurring theme in the academic literature on distributive policy is the tendency for legislators to form oversized coalitions to bestow benefits on virtually every district represented in the legislature. In this paper we offer two tests of the universalism hypothesis. First, we examine the distributional expectation of the universalism thesis under the assumption that separate logrolls occur over the distribution of benefits for individual programs. Se cond, we test the thesis under the assumption that logrolls occur over bundles of programs organized by policy subsystems. Our findings show that the evidence on the extent to which benefits from distributive programs are univer salized is weak. We suggest a number of reasons why these weak results might be expected. We argue that the incentive to universalize benefits is only one goal of legislators and may not always be the most fruitful strategy for enhanc ing their reelection prospects. © 1994, Sage Publications.

"This paper examines how ward representation affects zoning policies with respect to group homes that house or care for the mentally retarded, juvenile offenders, recovering alcoholics and/or drug users. The analysis is motivated by an interest representation model that contends that constituency homogeneity should cause elected officials to be attentive to revealed preferences of their constituents. As predicted, ward representation, which enhances constituency homogeneity, is strongly associated with the exclu sion of group homes in municipal zoning ordinances. The median household income of a city, relative to that of its metropolitan area, also has some ex clusionary effect.

"Many allege that Superfund is a pork-barrel program that serves self-interested federal legislators. An earlier empirical study found that Superfund cleanup priorities and expenditures were not dictated by congressional committee influence, but rather largely by public interest concerns. Despite this apparent denial of classic distributive politics, it is important to recognize that pork also can arise from legislators voting to expand programs when their constituents stand to benefit disproportionately. This study examines important House and Senate votes on Superfund for their correspondence to theories of congressional self-interest and ideology. On the whole, and despite its theoretical appeal as a potentially-classic pork-barrel program, congressional voting on Superfund is found to represent legislator's environmental and liberal ideologies as much as (if not more than) narrowly-defined self-interest. Along with the results of a previous study, this should be taken as evidence that Superfund has not consistently been a typical pork-barrel program, and that its rapid expansion and legislative support must be explained by other factors, including its symbolic environmental appeal. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",congressional voting on superfund: self-interest or ideology?,1993,Public Choice,"Hird, J.A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",674
"Two alternative models of legislative outcomes are the minimum winning coalition and the competitive equilibrium (Koford, 1982). In a unidimensional setting, the outcome under the former is the median, while the outcome under the latter is the highest net demand location. This paper describes the competitive equilibrium in a unidimensional model, and shows that under some common conditions it coincides with the median, in particular for pure redistributive issues. However, for distributive issues, the two equilibria will differ. Finally, the comparative statics of the two models are examined; while the winning coalition is sensitive only to changes in the location of the median, for ""distributive"" issues the competitive equilibrium has the standard ""economic"" comparative statics that the outcome adjusts in the direction of the change in preferences. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",the median and the competitive equilibrium in one dimension,1993,Public Choice,"Koford, K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The ratchet theory of government growth hypothesizes that temporary crises cause government spending to rise and to remain permanently higher than if the crises had not occurred. An examination of federal government spending in the United States since 1800 reveals apparent ratchets associated with the Great Depression, the two world wars, and the Civil War. After taking account of war-related spending and serial correlation in the data, however, only the World War I and Great Depression ratchets can be clearly identified, and they are closely associated with a major change in the underlying growth rate of government spending early in the 20th century.

"I develop a framework for applying existing formal models of restrictive amendment procedures in Congress to the study of the French government's use of two restrictive legislative procedures, the package vote and the “guillotine”. I test six hypotheses derived from existing formal models and from existing research on the French National Assembly. The analysis shows that the French government invokes the two procedures on the same types of distributive and jurisdictionally complex bills that frequently receive closed rules in Congress. The analysis also shows that the decision to use the restrictive procedures is strongly linked to the majority status of the government, suggesting they are used to preserve agreements between parties in the same way that restrictive amendment procedures are used to preserve agreements between individual members of Congress. Thus, existing formal models of legislative institutions can help us study how procedural structures shape strategic bargaining between political parties in parliamentary systems, especially during coalition and minority government. © 1992, American Political Science Association.

His later works, most notably A Disquisition on Government, argue for a strong version of states' rights, nullification, and secession. Earlier accounts of Calhoun's thought attribute this apparent contradiction to political expediency and opportunism. But I argue here that Calhoun's early nationalism was a reaction against the operation of multiple vetoes in the legislative process, requiring near unanimity to pass legislation. By 1825, however, Congress had evolved institutions that circumvented these vetoes, resulting in majoritarian redistribution. The later Calhoun opposed the legislation that followed from these circumventions and proposed an alternative form of unanimity, the concurring majority, as the appropriate corrective. © 1991 George Mason University.",calhoun's constitutional economics,1991,Constitutional Political Economy,"Aranson, P.H.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Without the imposition of some institutional structure, a legislature is a non-exclusive resource, and legislators will have a tendency to overuse the resource and reduce its productivity. The committee system is a method for granting property rights over the legislature's agenda by subdividing the agenda and assigning each committee rights over a portion of the agenda. Just as common grazing ground could be more productive if it were subdivided and assigned to individual owners, the legislature is more productive if access to the agenda is subdivided and assigned to committees. Ownership rights to committee assignments are allocated based on seniority because this makes the rights more secure and therefore more valuable to their owners. In the United States Congress, the seniority rule replaced a system in which assignments were made at the discretion of party leaders. In the former system, legislators needed to expend effort to retain their assignments, which diminished their ability to use their assignments productively. Because individuals can use resources more productively if they do not have to be concerned about protecting their ownership interest, the seniority system enables the legislature to be more productive in producing legislation. Viewing the legislature in this property rights framework sheds some light on two controversial issues in public choice. The question about legislators voting based on ideology rather than constituent interests is an example of discretionary behavior on the part of a legislator who is spending political capital. A legislator engaged in a very competitive battle for reelection will have little room for discretion, but surely the candidate is motivated by more than just the selfless desire to further constituent interests. Where there are barriers to entry, legislators build majorities capable of producing political capital. This political capital can be spent through discretionary behavior - including ideological voting - by the legislator (Parker, 1989). The other issue is stability under majority rule. By observing that the legislature is a valuable resource that can be used by legislators to further their own interests, it is clear that they have an incentive to manage the resource to be as productive as possible, which produces institutions that generate output valuable to the legislators rather than cycles. Economic theory suggests that when a small number of individuals are sharing a non-exclusive resource, they should be able to negotiate a rights structure that maximizes the value of the resource to those individuals. The committee system, with assignments protected by the seniority system, assigns rights to produce legislation in such a way as to maximize the value of the legislature to the legislators. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",committees in legislatures: a property rights perspective,1991,Public Choice,"Holcombe, R.G., Parker, G.R.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In previous studies of distributive politics scholars have investigated legislative influence without accounting for the policies' independent merits. As a result, they have failed to include a plausible explanation of the counterfactual (i.e., which projects would have been funded in the absence of congressional committee influence), which has led to invalid inferences regarding legislative influence. The model of distributive politics is reformulated to account for an assumed efficient and/or equitable project allocation in the absence of legislative influence. Using data from proposed Army Corps of Engineers' projects and the funding recommendations of three institutions, the findings indicate that pork barrel politics indeed exists and imposes significant efficiency costs but that both equity and economic efficiency play prominent roles in the decision-making process as well.

"Since its inception, Amtrak has required large federal operating and capital subsidies yet has maintained strong congressional support even in periods of record federal deficits. The benefits of Amtrak services accrue primarily to passengers and labor along its routes, and hence, like a pork-barrel program, Amtrak provides particularistic benefits at the expense of taxpayers. Based on the hypothesis that the politics of Amtrak are largely distributive, this paper investigates congressional action in 1979 that would eliminate or preserve Amtrak routes and hence the distribution of benefits and the corresponding subsidy. The theory is tested using six roll-call votes some of which pertained to specific routes and others of which pertained to Amtrak as a whole. The estimates for those votes that pertain to specific routes indicate that members of Congress from those districts affected voted in favor of preserving train service. For those votes that pertain to Amtrak as a whole, the data on the distributive consequences are less accurate, and the customary measure of ideology appears to reflect unmeasured distributive consequences. The continued existence of a nationwide, intercity passenger rail network thus rests on the political support derived from the distributive consequences it generates.",distributive politics and the persistence of amtrak,1990,The Journal of Politics,"Baron, D.P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A growing literature exists on constituency service and pork barrel politics in the United States. Comparative research on an electoral connection between representatives and their constituents has been limited, generally confined to the British case. The research reported here takes an initial step in broadening comparative research on pork barrel politics beyond the American and British cases. Although a case study of the Federal Republic of Germany, this article maintains a strong comparative perspective through its analysis of different types of electoral systems - single- and multimember districts. Our analysis tests the hypothesis that, ceteris paribus, single-member district systems possess stronger incentives than multimember districts for the distributive allocation of pork barrel projects. Through a close-ended mail questionnaire of representatives of the 1983-1986 German Bundestag, this research produces significant evidence to corroborate empirically this theoretical argument.

"Using data on all final National Priorities List (NPL) sites, this study employs an integrated model of distributive and public interest politics to determine whether the overall pace of cleanup efforts and funding of the 8.5 billion Superfund program over the past eight years reflects self‐interested congressional influence or public interest objectives. Despite the fact that both EPA and Congress have substantial incentives to promote the Superfund program, the results indicate that once a site is on the final NPL, there is little committee‐based congressional influence over the distribution of site cleanup or funding, although evidence exists that legislators can hasten a site's transition from proposed to final status on the NPL. The chief determinants of cleanup pace and level of funding are the site's Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scores, whether federal funds are financing the cleanup, and whether the site is designated as a state priority.

"This paper evaluates the claim that an increase in bureau competition will improve efficiency in the public supply of services. It gives explicit consideration to the property rights characteristics of a public sector market and to the role of legislators as active demanders of bureau output, rather than as passive monitors of bureau production. The analysis demonstrates that bureau managers prefer nonprice competition to price competition. A major prediction of the paper is that greater bureau competition may increase bureau output, costs and budgets. © 1990.",bureau competition and inefficiency. a reevaluation of theory and evidence,1990,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,"Carroll, K.A.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"I use basic tools of economic theory to construct a simple model of the behavior of dictatorships. Two extreme cases are considered: a “tin-pot” dictatorship, in which the dictator wishes only to minimize the costs of remaining in power in order to collect the fruits of office (palaces, Mercedes-Benzes, Swiss bank accounts), and a “totalitarian” dictatorship, whose leader maximizes power over the population. I show that the two differ in their responses to economic change. For example, a decline in economic performance will lead a tin-pot regime to increase its repression of the population, whereas it will lead a totalitarian government to reduce repression. The model also shows why military dictatorships (a subspecies of tin-pots) tend to be short-lived and often voluntarily hand power over to a civilian regime; explains numerous features of totalitarian regimes; and suggests what policies will enable democratic regimes to deal with dictatorships effectively. © 1990, American Political Science Association.

"This article analyzes the government's role in regulating asbestos‐related health hazards in the United States. The U.S. government has served as both promoter and regulator of the U.S. asbestos industry, and this article examines the extent to which—in both capacities—it has hindered rather than facilitated the information dissemination essential to voluntary assumption of asbestos related risks. In documenting the behavior of the major government actors, this paper investigates the political and economic forces that have shaped U.S. asbestos policy. It shows how the Congressional transition from promoter to regulator of the asbestos industry can be explained by the susceptibility of political processes to transaction‐cost augmentation by the bureaucracy.

"Abstract. This paper surveys the theoretical work that has been done on majority rule and economic models of elections. Section I provides an overview of the topic. Section 2 reviews the most important results that have been obtained about majority rule as an abstract collective choice rule. Section 3 identifies some alternative inferences that can be made from those results. Section 4 covers some models that include additional features that are present in political institutions where majority rule is used. Section 5 concentrates on some alternative election models and equilibrium concepts. Section 6 focuses on election models with abstentions and/or candidate uncertainty about voter behaviour. Section 7 compares and contrasts models where candidates are certain about what the voters’choices will be (contingent upon about the choices made by the candidates) and models where they are uncertain about those choices. Section 8 closes the survey by identifying some emerging areas of research. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

" In recent years, economists have increasingly focused attention on the en-
 dogenous choice of regulatory instruments. They have viewed the choice of
 instruments as a reflection of the underlying political competition. Among
 these scholars there is a variety of differences in emphasis. But none of these
 scholars accords a significant role to the legislature. They treat the legislature
 like a black box that accepts lobbying inputs from and systematically pro-
 cesses regulatory benefits for interest groups. In this article, we attempt to
 show that the legislature has a decisive influence on the choice. Specifically,
 we develop a generic legislative choice model and use it to indicate deficien-
 cies of previous models. Like these models, we assume regulation can be
 represented as a wealth transfer-gains to some groups in society and losses
 to others-and characterize a regulatory instrument as a specific configura-
 tion of gains and losses. Different configurations represent different instru-
 ments, that is, different means of redistribution. Unlike these models,
 however, we incorporate important work of political scientists on voting and
 legislative institutions (Axelrod; Bach, 1981a; 1981b; Black; Farquha  Fenno; Fiorina, 1977; Gilligan and Krehbiel, 1987; 1988a; 1988b; Kramer;
 Matthews; Mayhew; McKelvey; McCubbins and Schwartz; Oleszek; Polsby;
 Shepsle; Shepsle and Weingast; Weingast). We assume that the legislature
 is an active participant in the choice process.","legislative institutions, lobbying, and the endogenous choice of regulatory instruments: a political economy approach to instrument choice",1989,"Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization","Campos, J.E.L.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",699
"Seniority conveys political power to legislators despite the fact that all legislators have equally valuable voting power. What prevents a coalition of junior members from exercising their political power to form a coalition and claim an equal share of the power by eliminating the benefits of seniority? Several models explain how valuable services are supplied by senior members, so the returns to seniority may be looked at as compensation for their services. This still does not explain why the providers of those services should be chosen based on seniority rather than on some other criterion. Seniority is used because it provides benefits to every member of the legislature. Legislators want to be reelected, and regardless of the seniority level of an individual in the legislature, the incumbent will always have more seniority when running for reelection than the challenger. Since voters benefit from being represented by more senior representatives, the seniority system enhances the reelection chances of even the most junior representative. This argument implies that the most significant dimension of political competition is between incumbents and nonincumbents. There is a tendency to view political competition as between parties since on election day a member of one party will be opposed by a member of another party, but this obscures the actual nature of the competition. As revealed by their actions, incumbents are more closely allied with other incumbents in a different party than with their own party members who are challenging those other incumbents. Were this not so, members of the minority party would favor a weakening of the seniority system in order to enhance the party's opportunity to replace incumbents and become the majority party. Thus, understanding why the seniority system is a stable political institution also lends insight into the nature of political competition. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",a note on seniority and political competition,1989,Public Choice,"Holcombe, R.G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Rural planning is struggling to find a theoretical framework to replace the largely discredited rational-comprehensive and normative economic models. Rational planning assumed consensus and adequate instrumental knowledge. Normative economics ignored property institutions and could not resolve the unavoidable distributional questions so central to planning problems. This paper reviews some theoretical and practical issues relating to these problems and argues that ""bargaining"" best describes planning processes in mixed economies. Bargaining is a process of negotiation and trading off outcomes of decisions by the interested parties (or actors) within the loose constraints set by the political and legal context of the plan.

"Economists prescribe well-known remedies for those situations where private behavior does not maximize allocational efficiency. Legislatures, however, rarely enact microeconomic policies without substantially altering economists' solutions. Those who defend elected officials' alterations offer three categories of justification--windfall losses of income negate efficiency improvements; indirect redistribution, though inefficient, serves progressive goals without generally repudiating market incomes; command-and-control regulation produces valuable symbolic outputs. Only the first line of argument has merit. Policy prescriptions often are insensitive to the wealth losses they create and can be improved through congressional attention to distributional issues. For the most part, however, no normative goal is well served when Congress ignores economic efficiency in the design of policies.",should congress listen to economists?,1989,The Journal of Politics,"VanDoren, P.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Different types of legislative politics are explained by the distribution and intensity of legislators' demands. Demands are legislators' willingness to pay for victory on a bill. Different demand distributions require different institutional structures and ""politics"" for the legislators to obtain the results they want.

The paper describes the demand distributions formally, and then identifies the institutional structures and ""politics"" required to write and pass bills for distributive, regulative, and redistributive demand distributons. Applying the principle to case studies, differences from Lowi's classification are found; the actual politics are better predicted by the demand approach.","different preferences, different politics: a demand-and-structure explanation",1989,Political Research Quarterly,"Koford, K.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Understanding the dynamics of policy distribution requires an appreciation of federal grant programs that have achieved a prominent place in nearly all areas of domestic policy. The theoretical literature on distributive politics, however, focuses almost exclusively on a centralized, top-down view of policy distribution. By examining the role of presidents, legislators, and bureaucrats, scholars have ignored participants who have become key actors in the distribution of federal expenditures—the recipient jurisdictions. This analysis of the allocation patterns under six federal programs shows that local governments exert important influences on the distribution of federal grants and that the distributional patterns and their determinants vary over time. The analysis also points out the importance of disaggregation by focusing on programs and recipient jurisdictions, as opposed to total federal expenditures and regions, states, or congressional districts. © 1989, American Political Science Association.

"Information advantages of firms over government are an important cause of policy failures in government-financed technology. Using a game-theory model, such failures can be reconstructed as a situation, analogous to the prisoner's dilemma, in which rational individual action results in an outcome that is suboptimal for both, industry and government. By logic of economic theory, any Pareto-deficient information asymmetry between industry and government qualifies as market failure. The resulting policy failure, therefore, represents a case of government failure joined with market failure. Cost-sharing between government and industry can solve the problem, and a way to calculate the optimal level of cost-sharing is shown. However, in many cases cost-sharing is unfeasible or undesirable.

"For many years political scientists have utilized the subgovernment model of policy‐making to explain certain types of policy output. Recently a number of scholars have argued that the traditional conceptualization of subgovernments was simplistic and incomplete. They view subgovernments as a complex and integral part of the larger policy‐making environment. This paper examines this “new” subgovernment by analyzing its role in contemporary public policy‐making. If subgovernments have lost their autonomy and been exposed to the complex demands of the larger political system, what impact does this have on policy outputs? Relying upon the literature on subgovernments and their principal components, the paper offers an interpretation of how subgovernments have potentially expanded their influence on public policy as a result of two contemporary developments: policy‐making fragmentation, and the accommodation of policy outputs.

"In recent decades, U.S. senators have made increasing use of complex unanimous consent agreements (UCAs) which preclude filibusters by setting a time for a final vote on legislation and which often specify permissible amendments and their proposers. Because of the numerous dilatory tactics permitted in the absence of a UCA, controversial legislation is often doomed unless such an agreement is reached. But in spite of correspondingly strong temptations for opponents to object to unanimous consent requests (UCRs), consent is prevalent. This paper addresses the puzzle with a decision-theoretic model that yields a rather stringent condition for objection to a UCR. Two cases of objection in the Senate are analyzed and found to support hypotheses derived from the model. A concluding discussion considers UCAs as endogenous institutions that permit Senate leaders to induce behavior that appears cooperative but is nonetheless consistent with individual utility maximization. © 1986, Southern Political Science Association.

"Most models of agenda control examine dyadic relations—for example, those between a committee and the floor of a legislature. Such relations, however, are always embedded in a larger context, namely, a political environment composed of voters and interest groups. In this paper we model agenda setters (a legislative committee) as decision makers with limited cognitive abilities who adjust over time to their larger political environment. The legislators’ policy positions are endogenous, reflecting the relative strengths of voters wielding the district-specific resource of votes and of interest groups wielding the transferable resource of money. The resulting outcomes indicate that neoclassical models of voting and pluralist models of group influence have each told part of the story. When only votes matter, our boundedly rational agents grope toward equilibria close to those of neoclassical models; however, when mobile resources matter as well, the outcomes depart systematically from those of previous models. In particular, interest groups can make themselves worse off by capturing the committee. The results suggest that agenda control is less powerful than conventionally believed and point toward conditions shaping its effectiveness—conditions highlighting the distinctive contributions of pluralist and neoclassical thinking to a broader theory of political institutions. © 1986, American Political Science Association.

"In collective decision making, unanimous agreement is accepted as a benchmark for economic efficiency, because with everyone in agreement on an
issue, a Pareto superior move will result from the issue's approval.1 This
view of unanimous agreement is not completely accurate, though, because
when unanimous agreement occurs under a less than unanimous decision
rule, a situation could arise in which individuals could agree with a majority
in order to avoid being in the minority. There is an important distinction
to be made between a decision rule of unanimity and unanimous agreement
under a less than unanimous decision rule. Under a unanimous decision
making rule, every voter has veto power, and so can vote against an issue
to keep it from being approved. This means that under a unanimous decision rule, nobody will approve an issue unless approval makes the individual
better off that the status quo. Under a less inclusive rule like simple majority
rule, an issue can be approved without the vote of any particular voter, as
long as a majority of the voters approve. Typically, the voter's single vote
will not affect the outcome of a majority rule election. Thus, the voter faces
the more complex choice of being in the majority coalition or in the minority
coalition. Sometimes a voter will be better off in the majority coalition than
in the minority coalition even if changes proposed by the majority coalition
make the voter worse off than the status quo. Therefore, one would not be
justified in concluding that because there is unanimous agreement on an
issue, everyone is made better off. Unanimous agreement under majority
rule may result from all voters in a majority rule system being better off in
the majority rather than the minority, even if the change that is unanimously
approved is not a Pareto superior move",non-optimal unanimous agreement,1986,Public Choice,"Holcombe, R.G.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Perspectives from political science and economics are drawn on to suggest an integrated theory of governmental corruption. The theory is oriented toward policy choices, and corruption is viewed as a product of individual and structural variables that interact to produce both positive and negative consequences. Individual-level considerations such as greed and the likelihood of detection and prosecution suggest one set of policies for reducing corruption. Bureaucratic constraints, citizen participation, and the congruence of legal structures and social demands offer a competing set of concerns that must be dealt with in analyzing corrupt practices. We show that corruption, as a process, influences the optimal level of social welfare. Alternative conceptions are examined, and a model is developed to evaluate policy choices related to corruption from the perspective of welfare optimization. Applied to the analysis of corruption, the model integrates general equilibrium theory, deterrence theory, and structural conditions.

"Pork barrel politics is a particular type of constituency service through which a legislator's geographic constituency benefits from the distribution of public works projects. The desire for reelection prompts a representative to use his influence to initiate local projects.

This model suggests that the electoral accountability linkage is strongest in coun tries with single-member districts and weakest in those with at-large districts.

"This paper provides new evidence on bias in preference revelation and valuation of public goods. It does so through the systematic definition of free-rider, mixed-good, information and social choice problems and by a survey application to the case of valuing social benefit from the arts. These sources of bias are each found to be significant. It is also found that free-rider behaviour is random with respect to observable socio-demographic characteristics. Allowing for bias, aggregate public good benefit necessary for public support of arts is still established. The study therefore demonstrates not only the significance of free-rider and other biases in eliciting public good demand, but also practicable techniques for allowing for these effects via a survey method. © 1986.",strategic bias and demand for public goods. theory and an application to the arts,1986,Journal of Public Economics,"Throsby, C.D., Withers, G.A.",Scopus,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",714
"Spatial models of electoral competition typically simplify the analysis by ignoring the question of internal constituency politics: constituencies are modeled simply as a distribution of ideal points along a set of issue dimensions.

"The empirical literature on the control of bureaus notes that politicians have difficulty observing bureaucratic output, but this insight is rarely represented informal models. To analyze how bureaus use this uncertainty strategically, we develop a model of expertise-based agenda control, building on the Niskanen (1971) and Miller and Moe (1983) tradition. We show that under some plausible conditions, bureaus will underestimate the benefits, and overestimate the costs, of their programs. In the model, politicians are neither passive nor omniscient: they anticipate the bureau's strategic behavior and establish a monitoring system to counteract it. This possibility of detection changes the bureau's behavior: even imperfect monitoring reduces the bureau's deception of the legislature, whether or not the legislature's demand for the bureau's services is concealed. Moreover, uncertainty by itself matters: if the legislature makes it harder for a risk-averse bureau chief to predict demand or penalty, the bureau will restrain its deception. © 1985, American Political Science Association.

"The basic result of this paper is that when government provides either public goods, private goods with externalities, or transfers motivated by altruism, public provision is large enough to completely crowd out private provision. In contrast, when government provides private goods, public provision redistributes resources without completely crowding out private provision. Thus the coexistence of public and private provision indicates a private good; public provision that completely crowds out private provision indicates a public good or the presence of externalities. The model argues that national defense, aid to the poor, aid to the poor elderly, and municipal activities such as street-cleaning are publicly provided for efficiency. Public fire and police protection are also consistent with the efficiency argument. Goods and transfers which are publicly provided for purely redistributive reasons are: aid to farmers, social security to the middle and upper class, postal service, and education. The model allows public provision to transfer resources to indirect demanders. Even when public activity is motivated by efficiency considerations, it structures provision to redistribute some of the gains. Perhaps direct demanders receive their preferred level of public goods and altruistic transfers without indirect demanders receiving rents. This leaves unexplained the excess applications to become postal workers and school teachers, for example, and the intense lobbying efforts on the part of defense contractors, welfare recipients, the Gray Panthers, and the local teachers union. As usual, many simplifying assumptions were made in this paper in order to get results. For example, treating the political process as a sequential process ignores interactions among different types of goods. In addition, I assumed fixed endowments, that individuals interact in a Cournot-Nash fashion, and that no citizens are indifferent to the public good or dislike it. Relaxing these assumptions may weaken the predictions or yield additional implications. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",a taxonomy of public provision,1985,Public Choice,"Roberts, R.D.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Congressional scholars have frequently reported dramatic shifts in the mood of Congress toward federal spending. In seeking to explain these fluctuations in congressional moods, we develop and estimate an “electoral connection” model of the congressional appropriations process. In this model appropriations decisions are seen to be the product of the responses of reelection-seeking members of Congress to the key political and economic variables in their environment. Analyses of appropriations for thirty-seven federal agencies between fiscal years 1948 and 1979 provided broad support for our hypotheses. First, Congress has been more generous in awarding appropriations during election years than during nonelection years. Appropriations are also influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Higher unemployment leads to higher levels of appropriations, especially for public works agencies. Conversely, Congress has responded to high rates of inflation by holding down appropriations. And as in other areas of public policy, parties matter: the larger the percentage of Democrats in the House of Representatives, the more funds agencies were appropriated. The strong empirical support garnered by our electoral connection model thus adds some much needed balance to the conventional incrementalist view of federal government spending. © 1985, Southern Political Science Association.

"This paper presented a general formal model of policy choice. The assumptions upon which the model is based are well founded in the literature and generally non-controversial. The model is also one of legislative choice and the consequences derived also speak to significant issues in the study of legislatures: the policy nature of representation, the impact of electoral incentives, and the relationship of legislators to their constituents. In this way, the model unifies two subfields of research-policy and legislative politics-into a general framework. Several important consequences follow formally from the calculus we have presented. Legislators will prefer to select ""indirect"" forms of policy whenever possible: this preference is for forms of policies which muddle the perception of costs incident to the policy. The legislator's preference for command and control regulatory instruments and for particularistic policies are principal examples of this consequence. The possibilities for melding the advantages of market (or exchange) and political (or authority) control systems are, then, seemingly remote (cf. Lindblom, 1977). The representative system of democracy, and the incentives it provides for legislators, hinder the imposition of market-like incentive system in favor of the more indirect ""thumbs, no fingers"" mechanisms. Further consequences, that legislators will select policies which benefit groups with high support rates for the legislator, i.e. his primary and re-election constituencies, were derived. A number of these consequences are new and unique. A number have been derived elsewhere, though, through a variety of specific modeling techniques. That all of these consequences follow from this general model developed here is one of the model's principal strengths. © 1984 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.",constituency influences on legislative policy choice,1984,Quality and Quantity,"McCubbins, M.D., Sullivan, T.",Scopus,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"I break down gubernatorial electoral outcomes into expected vote and short-term changes, using an intrastate baseline measure. Employing these measures, I find evidence of period effects in the role played by incumbency, including the growth in its importance in the last decade.

Other factors influencing incumbents’ success are less clear in their impact: Sabato's measure of reputation is associated with electoral gains, but increasingstate bureaucratization appears more weakly linked. © 1984, Southern Political Science Association.

"For some, market failures serve as a rationale for public intervention. However, the fact that self-interested market behavior does not always produce felicitous social consequences is not sufficient reason to draw this conclusion. It is necessary to assess public performance under comparable conditions, and hence to analyze self-interested political behavior in the institutional structures of the public sector.

"A paper like this does not lend itself to conclusions. The unifying theme of the paper is a question: when and why does Congress choose to modify social and/or economic behavior by establishing a regulatory agency rather than by writing a law to be enforced in the courts? This is a special case of the more general question of why politicians delegate their power to administrators. I have not sought to answer that question in any definite way; rather, I have tried to identify some of the potential answers, most of which are mutually compatible, all of which have some support in the literature, and few of which have been dealt with systematically by modern political economists. I have ignored certain answers that appear in the literature - the complexity of modern problems, the demands on legislator time, and so forth. These may have some effect on what Congress decides to delegate, but in the main I believe they are largely rationalizations which scholars are too quick to believe. Where politicians have the incentive, they manage to deal with complexity, and they find the time to do it. It is our job to identify those incentives and trace their implications for the formation of public policy in this country.

The analysis reveals that in both cases the EU’s negotiating position was largely in line with the demands voiced by economic interests.

"We present a model where groups attempt to influence policies using both bribes (plata, Spanish for silver) and the threat of punishment (plomo, Spanish for lead). We then use it to make predictions about the quality of a country’s public officials and to understand the role of institutions granting politicians with immunity from legal prosecution. The use of punishment lowers the returns from public office and reduces the incentives of high-ability citizens to enter public life. Cheaper plomo and more resources subject to official discretion are associated with more frequent corruption and less able politicians. This predicts that violence in a country will typically go together with corruption and worse politicians. Moreover, the possibility of punishment changes the nature of the influence game, so that even cheaper plata can lower the ability of public officials. Protecting officials from accusations of corruption (immunity) will decrease the frequency of corruption if the judiciary is weak and may increase the quality of politicians. These predictions cannot emerge from a traditional model where only bribes are used. The positive evils and dangers of the representative, as of every other form of government, may be reduced to two heads: first, general ignorance and incapacity, or, to speak more moderately, insufficient mental qualifications, in the controlling body; secondly, the danger of its being under the influence of interests not identical with the general welfare of the community.",“plata o plomo?”: bribe and punishment in a theory of political influence,2006,American Political Science Review,"Ernesto Dal Bo1, Pedro Dal Bo2, Rafael Di Tella31University of California, Berkeley, 2Brown University, 3Harvard University",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Three features are often present in models of distributive politics: (i) individual legislators are assumed to care mainly or exclusively about the public projects that flow into their districts, (ii) the tax system that finances public projects is fixed and “decoupled” from the projects themselves — e.g., taxes are proportional to income or population; and (iii) the legislature is assumed adopt a norm of universalism, in which all projects proposed are passed (perhaps in one omnibus budget bill, or a small number of such bills). These assumptions lead to an oversupply of public projects, sometimes called “the law of 1/n”(Weingast, Shepsle and Johnsen 1981). In this paper we demonstrate that the payo function assumed for legislators in the literature is incorrect, at least for the case of pure public goods.

We expand Denzau and Mungerâ€™s 1986 model of â€˜How Unorganized Interests Get Representedâ€™ to address cross-national differences in electoral systems. We look at how individual legislators allocate their efforts to serving unorganized constituents versus organized groups. Our model shows how the optimal allocation of effort is affected by differences in nominating processes and electoral rules. Our findings include the following: (1) Closed-list proportional representation (PR) makes legislators generally more responsive to interest groups and less responsive to unorganized voters than single-member districts (SMD). (2) This difference becomes smaller as the personal component of the SMD vote diminishes. (3) Legislators elected via lists in a mixed system may be even less responsive to the unorganized than legislators in a pure list system.,"a comparative theory of electoral incentives representing the unorganized under pr, plurality and mixed-member electoral systems",2003,Journal of Theoretical Politics,"Kathleen Bawn1, Michael F.

"A burgeoning literature argues that the abundance of oil in developing countries strengthens autocratic rule and erodes democracy. However, extant studies either show the average cross-national correlation between oil and political regime or develop particularistic accounts that do not easily lend themselves to theorizing. Consequently, we know little of the causal mechanisms that potentially link oil wealth to undemocraticoutcomes and the conditions that would help explain the ultimate, not average, effect of oil on political regime.This study develops a conditional theory of the “political resource curse.” It does so by undertaking a statistical reassessment of the relationship between oil wealth and political regime and a nuanced qualitative examination of a set of carefully selected cases in order to contribute to developing an adequate account of causal mechanisms that transmit and conditions that shape the relationship between oil abundance and autocracy. It draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence collected over eighteen months of fieldwork in oil-rich former Soviet countries of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and the ‘counterfactual’ oil-poor Kyrgyzstan. Employing a theoretical framework that draws on insights from the rentier state theory, historical institutionalism, and rational choice institutionalism, I trace, compare, and contrast the processes that potentially link oil wealth to regime outcomes in these countries between 1989 and 2010. The findings strongly suggest that political regime differences can be better explained by the interaction of oil wealth with several structural and institutional variables rather than by oil abundance or another single factor alone. A thorough qualitative analysis of the post-Soviet cases shows that the causal mechanisms hypothesized in the ‘resource curse’ literature were neither necessarily present, nor uniform across these cases and throughout the post-Soviet period. This was because a particular interaction of exogenous variables and oil wealth affected the causal mechanisms differently, ultimately entailing different regime outcomes. The spread of alternative political elites, relative size of the ethnic minority with ties to a powerful kin state, and oil production geography were key exogenous factors that consistently interacted with oil in affecting the political regimes.","a conditional theory of the 'political resource curse' : oil, autocrats, and strategic contexts",2011,NA,Anar Kamil Ahmadov,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper presents a dynamic political economy theory of public spending, taxation and debt. Policy choices are made by a legislature consisting of representatives elected by geographically-defined districts. The legislature can raise revenues via a distortionary income tax and by borrowing. These revenues can be used tofinance a national public good and district-specific transfers (interpreted as pork-barrel spending). The value of the public good is stochastic, reflecting shocks such as wars or natural disasters. In equilibrium, policy-making cycles between two distinct regimes: “business-as-usual” in which legislators bargain over the allocation of pork, and “responsible-policy-making” in which policies maximize the collective good. Transitions between the two regimes are brought about by shocks in the value of the public good. In the long run, equilibrium tax rates are too high and too volatile, public good provision is too low and debt levels are too high. In some environments, a balanced budget requirement can improve citizen welfare.","a dynamic theory of public spending, taxation and debt",2006,The American Economic Review,"Marco Battaglini1, Stephen Coate21Princeton University, 2Cornell University",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In this paper, I present a distributive politics model based on Baron(1993). The model adds two real-world political institutions to a distributive politics framework: (i) a veto-wielding executive who is subject to legislative override; and (ii) a legislature that can impose a budget cap on itself. I show that the legislature improves its welfare when it can impose a budget cap before it determines allocations in legislative districts. Its welfare also improves when a conservative executive is in office. In addition, several counterintuitive propositions emerge. For instance, suppose the legislature can limit its own spending; then it actually spends more when the executive is conservative (i.e., prefers less distributive spending) as opposed to liberal. In addition, regardless of the executive’s preferences, a budget cap has the effect of lowering spending, relative to not having a budget cap in effect. These theoretical results generate several testable predictions about spending patterns, which can be analyzed by taking advantage of the rich institutional variation in the U.S. states.",a formal model of distributive politics with an executive and a budget cap,2001,NA,David M.

"This paper develops a theoretical model of voters' and politicians' behavior based on the notion that voters focus disproportionately on, and hence overweight, certain attributes of policies. We assume that policies have two attributes and that voters focus more on the attribute in which their options differ more. First, we consider exogenous policies and show that voters' focusing polarizes the electorate. Second, we consider the endogenous supply of policies by office-motivated politicians who take voters' distorted focus into account. We show that focusing leads to inefficient policies, which cater excessively to a subset of voters: social groups that are larger, have more distorted focus, are more moderate, and are more sensitive to changes in a single attribute are more in uential. Finally, we show that augmenting the classical models of voting and electoral competition with focusing can contribute to explain puzzling stylized facts as the inverse correlation between income inequality and redistribution or the backlash effect of extreme policies.

"In recent years the growth pattern of most Southern European countries has been disturbed, as those countries are suffering from economic crises that go beyond the usual business cycle. In this paper, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model of market and political power interactions that explains this growth reversal. Moreover, the model is consistent with several stylized facts of those countries, where wages in the public sector relative to the private sector are high and these wage differentials correlate negatively with public sector employment over total employment, total factor productivity, and output growth. The model is a synthesis of the insiders-outsiders labor market structure and the concept of an elite government. Outsiders form a group of workers that supply labor to a competitive private sector. And, insiders form a group of workers that enjoy market power in supplying labor to the public sector and influence the policy decisions of government, including those that affect the development and maintenance of public sector infrastructures.",a model of market and political power interactions for southern europe,2015,NA,"Tryphon Kollintzas1, Dimitris Papageorgiou2, Vanghelis Vassilatos31Athens University of Economics and Business, 2Bank of Greece, 3University of Ioannina",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The wage premium in the public sector, as measured by the ratio of the average wage rate in the public sector relative to the average wage rate in the private sector, varies considerably across developed economies. And, varies in some developed economies over large periods of time. Further, this wage premium in the public sector correlates negatively with the conditional growth rate, in a representative panel of developed economies. This paper develops a simple neoclassical growth model, motivated by the paradigm of the South European countries that top the list of developed economies with the highest wage premium in the public sector, to provide for a unifying explanation for these stylized facts. According to this model, the latter are consequences of the different organization of the labor market and an associated political system complementarity. Labor supply consists of two groups: “outsiders”, that are employed by the private sector (final good) and take the wage rate as given, and “insiders” that are employed by the public sector (services associated with intermediate goods, such as basic networks and utilities) and are members of unions that set the wage rate. In this case, there will be a wage premium in the public sector and an associated labor misallocation effect. The number of intermediate goods raises the wage premium due to the assumed gross complementarity in the production of the final good. Thus, unions have an incentive to cooperate, so as to control/influence government and, thereby, the maintenance of existing and the creation of new intermediate goods. This is the above mentioned political system complementarity. Whether, steady state output and growth towards the steady state rise or fall with an increase in the number of intermediate goods, depends on the existing number of these goods. If this number is relatively low (high), the “variety” effect dominates over (is dominated by) the combination of the labor misallocation and distorting taxation effects. The latter stems from distortionary income taxation, needed to finance the infrastructure of the publicly provided intermediate goods. Then, it is shown that, for plausible parameter values, in the steady state, a “government of insiders”, that seeks to maximize the aggregate of insiders’ unions utilities, will tend to have a higher number of publicly provided intermediate goods than the number that would have been chosen by the Median Voter. These results form the basis for explaining the above mentioned stylized facts, as well as important aspects of the present crisis of the South European economies.",a neoclassical growth model for the insiders outsiders society,2013,NA,"Tryphon Kollintzas1, Dimitris Papageorgiou2, Vanghelis Vassilatos31Athens University of Economics and Business, 2Bank of Greece, 3University of Ioannina",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Why do soft budget constraints exist and persist? In this paper we argue that the prevalence of soft budget constraints can be best explained by the political desirability of softness. We develop an infinite horizon political economy model where neither democratic nor autocratic politicians can commit to policies that are not ex post optimal. We show that because of the dynamic commitment problem inherent in the soft budget constraint, politicians can in essence commit to make transfers to entrepreneurs which otherwise they would not be able to do. This encourages such entrepreneurs to support them politically. Though the soft budget constraint may induce economic inefficiency, it may be politically rational because it influences the probability of political survival. In consequence, even when information is complete, politicians may fund bad projects which they anticipate they will have to bail out in the future. We show that, maybe somewhat surprisingly, dictators who are less likely to lose power, are more likely to use the soft budget constraint as a strategy to gain political support.",a political economy theory of the soft budget constraint,2009,European Economic ReviewNational Bureau of Economic Research,"James A.

"This paper develops an open-economy growth model to analyze the growth and welfare effects of the European Union's R&D policy. In the case of independent countries, each national government chooses the level of government-funded research non-cooperatively and fails to internalize the spillover effects across countries. Consequently, government-funded research is underprovided. In an economic union, the central government budget causes the common-pool problem and leads to an overprovision of government-funded research. Within this framework, we find that although an economic union dominates independent countries in economic growth, the welfare domination is ambiguous. In particular, there is a critical degree of cross-country spillover above (below) which an economic union dominates (is dominated by) independent countries in social welfare.",a politico-economic analysis of the european union’s r&d policy,2009,Journal of Macroeconomics,"Angus C.

We categorize and examine trends in state and industry characteristics to determine if any one of these theories best explains the regulation of casinos. Based on our review of the state-level data, we conclude that the legalization and regulation of casinos best conform to a Leviathan theory of government in which the primary policy goal is to maximize government revenues.",a review of regulatory theory and the u.s. casino industry,2016,The Journal of Gambling Business and Economics,"Peter T.

"I present a theoretical account of the politics of privatization that predicts left-wing support for the policy is conditional on the proportionality of the electoral system. In contrast to accounts that see privatization as an inherently right-wing policy, I argue that, like trade policy, it has the feature of creating distributed benefits and concentrated costs. Less proportional electoral systems create incentives for the Left to be responsive to those who face the concentrated costs, and thus for them to oppose privatization more strongly. More proportional systems reduce these incentives and increase the extent to which distributed benefits are internalized by elected representatives. Hypotheses are derived from this theory at both the individual and macro-policy level, and then tested separately. Quantitative evidence on public opinion from the 1990s and privatization revenues from Western European countries over the period 1980-2005 supports the argument.","acting right? privatization, encompassing interests, and the left",2016,Political Science Research and Methods,Timothy Hicks1University College London,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The literature on gender has attempted to explain the differences between the public outcome depending on whether the ruler is male or female, on the basis that men and women have different preferences. This scientific research has not yet examined issues related to fiscal crises, and our research aims to fill this gap. In a context of generalised economic crisis, our research examines if the gender of the mayor affected the fiscal adjustment policies carried out by municipalities with fiscal deficits in the Spanish region of Galicia. Our paper suggests that although gender of the mayor does not seem to have affected the level of adjustment in total current expenditure, it does seem to have influenced the way in which social and non-social spending were adjusted. Our study also highlights that female mayors are associated with lower levels of tax revenues and this could slow the adjustment processes of fiscal imbalances.",adjustments in municipal fiscal crises. are they different according to the gender of the mayor,2018,Local Government Studies,"Roberto Cabaleiro Casal1, Enrique Buch Gómez1University of Vigo",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The article addresses a public sector principal-agent relationship under a financial regime of block grants. Two types of questions arise in principal-agent relations in this setting. The first is whether a public sector agent can force the principal to approve budgets that are away from the principal's ideal point, or if it is the principal that is the strong party in the relationship and can determine the agent's budget. The second is whether the agent can exploit a situation of asymmetric information or neglect from the principal, to lower efficiency. Predictions from different assumptions of the principal-agent relationship are empirically tested on data from counties and county run hospitals in Norway. Results show that counties have the upper hand in the relationship and can set hospital budgets. However, agents reduce efficiency when budgets are increased and counties can not prevent efficiency from falling by monitoring the agent. Under a block grant financing system counties face a tradeoff between cost-efficiency and production. Low budgets lead to high efficiency and low production. High budgets lead to low efficiency and high production.",agenda setting power and moral hazard in principal‐agent relationships: evidence from hospital budgeting in norway,1997,European Journal of Political Research,Terje P.

"This paper, which draws on principles from the new institutional economics and institutional analysis, argues that a principal underlying cause of the lack of sustained rural infrastructure investments in developing countries is the set or sets of perverse incentives facing participants in the development and operation of such facilities. The analysis examines the intermediate transaction costs of providing and producing public goods under six different institutional arrangements, each of which creates a different set of incentives for the many actors involved in the design, construction, finance, operation, maintenance, and use of rural infrastructure. By considering a full set of intermediate transaction costs and a wider array of institutional arrangements, analysts can become aware of the tradeoffs involved and may more likely identify those alternatives that yield genuine net cost reductions.",alternative institutional arrangements for sustaining rural infrastructure in developing countries,2016,NA,"Elinor Ostrom, Larry Schroeder, Susan Wynne",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The existence of a natural resource curse has been a longstanding theme in the economic literature and in policy discussions. We propose an alternative mechanism and study its policy implications. The mechanism is based on the interaction between two building blocks: specialization in non-tradables and financial market imperfections. We show that if a country has a sufficiently large non-resource tradable sector, relative prices can be stable, even when the resource sector generates significant volatility in the demand for non-tradables. However, when the non-resource tradable sector disappears, the economy becomes much more volatile, because shocks to the demand for non-tradables - possibly associated with shocks to resource income - will not be accommodated by movements in the allocation of labor but instead by expenditure-switching. This requires much higher relative price movements. The presence of bankruptcy costs makes interest rates dependent on relative price volatility. These two effects interact causing the economy to specialize inefficiently away from non-resource tradables: the less it produces of them, the greater the volatility of relative prices, the higher the interest rate the sector faces, causing it to shrink even further until it disappears. At that point, the economy will face an even higher interest rate and a lower level of capital and output in the non-tradable sector. An increase in resource income that leads to specialization causes a large decline in welfare: thus the idea of the curse. Specialization is determined by the expected size and volatility in resource income. The paper justifies stabilization and savings policies as well as policies to make financial markets more efficient. However, we also find some support for more interventionist second-best trade and financial",an alternative interpretation of the 'resource curse': theory and policy implications,2003,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ricardo Hausmann1, Roberto Rigobon21Harvard University, 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The rational-choice logic of majority rule embodies discriminatory distribution of burdens and benefits as between members of majority and minority coalitions. Empirical observation, however, suggests universality or near-universality, even in programs that are potentially discriminatory. Attempts have been made to explain the anomaly, but the basic issues have not been resolved. Weingast and others have argued that working legislatures will implicitly adopt quasi-unanimity rules or conventions. We present an alternative model of distributive majoritarian politics. The distinctive feature is ""common access."" If democratic politics is modeled, not in terms of a monolithic decision structure, but instead as a setting where differing and separate decision authorities are granted access to the general taxable capacity, collective action can be analyzed in the logic of common resource usage. Our model allows for universality, even with pork-barrel spending, without resort to institutionalized rules or informal conventions. ""Democracy,"" generically understood, embodies majority rule as a central feature, both in the electoral selection of agents and in the processes through which these agents generate outcomes in legislative assemblies. The basic rational-choice logic of majority rule embodies discriminatory separation between majorities and minorities and, unless constitutional constraints are interposed, this logic implies differentiation among levels of benefits and harms accruing to or imposed on those impacted by collective action. Empirical observation of patterns of outcomes generated by legislatures suggests, however, that the discrimination derived from rational-choice models does not seem descriptive.

While, as expected, income is negatively related with corruption, education is not; its positive impact on corruption can be explained as if corruption in Italy was typically a 'white collars' phenomenon during the 1980s and 1990s.

"This paper deals with a key proposition: that individuals within well-defined institutions engage in universalistic practices when confronting decisions as to the distribution of the political ""pork-barrel."" To examine such a proposition, district-level data on rivers and harbors appropriations from 1889 through 1913 are examined. This period is particularly interesting because of the structural changes occurring within the House over this relatively short period of time. The concern is with the distributional practices occurring in the House of Representatives over these appropriations. The findings show that oversized coalitions of districts obtained river and harbor projects throughout the period.","an empirical test of preferences for the political pork barrel: district level appropriations for river and harbor legislation, 1889-1913",1986,American Journal of Political Science,Rick K.

"This paper develops a simple model of institutionally driven party competition which may explain the persistence of divided government. In the basic model, two parties that are solely motivated to win elections compete for two offices, the legislature and the executive. Parties offer positions in a single dimension to a single-district sophisticated electorate that understands the institutionally defined relationship between electoral and policy outcomes. When parties are risk-averse, competition for the two offices leads to a prisoner's dilemma: the parties can jointly improve on the one-shot Nash equilibrium in which they adopt convergent positions. Several extensive form election games are shown to allow the parties to solve their prisoner's dilemma in a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. In such an equilibrium, parties adopt widely separated positions, and divided government and splitticket voting occur with high probability. Unlike typical voting models, in the basic model there is no tendency for electoral equilibrium to produce the (expected) median voter's ideal policy outcome. These results are robust to a variety of extensions, including significant sincere voting, multiple policy dimensions, and defections by incumbent candidates.",an institutional theory of divided government and party polarization,1993,American Journal of Political Science,"Daniel Ingberman, John Villani",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"By constraining political incentives and discretion, the numerical fiscal rules are among the main institutional (legal) instruments to ensure fiscal discipline. As stated in this paper, in order to be effective, the numerical fiscal rules need to inflict sufficiently high costs for their violation, which would outweigh the political benefits of excessive deficits. The paper attempts to answer two questions with regard to fiscal rules. First, it inquiries whether there is a difference in effectiveness between the numerical fiscal rules imposed by the international treaties and those enacted domestically. Second, it examines the effectiveness of the selected qualitative features of the national numerical fiscal rules. The results included in this paper show that while the national fiscal rules are associated with improved budget balance, this link is weaker for the supranational rules. Also, according to the results, the formal enforcement mechanism turned out to be the most important institutional element in guaranteeing the rules’ effectiveness.",are (fiscal) rules made to be broken? the law and economics analysis of the numerical fiscal constraints,2014,NA,Jaroslaw Kantorowicz1Leiden University,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper investigates the effect of recent reforms of budgetary institutions in Uganda and Zambia. We argue that cash budgeting has brought clear benefits in terms of improved expenditure control with regard to line ministries. However, contrary to what is often suggested, adoption of a cash budget has not provided a means for top politicians in either country to `tie their hands` with respect to intervention in fiscal policy decisions. In Uganda improved fiscal policy outcomes have, in fact, been achieved as a result of (and not in spite of) discretionary interventions by top politicians. In Zambia, a strict rule imposing a balanced budget on a monthly basis is both ineffective as a commitment device and costly in terms of increased volatility of expenditures.",are cash budgets a cure for excess fiscal deficits (and at what cost),2000,World Development,"David Stasavage1, Dambisa Moyo21London School of Economics and Political Science, 2University of Oxford",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The present paper aims at assessing the possible efficiency of the principle of national contributions, assumed in the 2015 Paris Framework Convention on Climate Change. Strong historical evidence indicates that any significant development of constitutional states used to take place, in the past, on the rising tide of demographic growth. Presently, we are facing global demographic slowdown, and contesters argue that constitutional states are not the right address to write to if we want breakthrough technological change. This paper assumes that the capacity of constitutional states to carry out the obligations declared in the Framework Convention, i.e. to carry out deep technological changes in the global economy, depends on their economic power, which can be estimated as their capacity to appropriate capital. Empirical data, examined in this article, indicates that since the 1980s, constitutional states have been losing their economic power, and that the overall technological progress is more and more disconnected from that economic power of governments. Moreover, constitutional states seem to be losing their capacity to experiment with their own institutions.",are constitutional states able to drive the global technological change,2016,NA,Krzysztof Waśniewski1Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow University,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A common political claim is that decentralized governments undermine policy-makers' ability to resist fiscal imbalance. This paper examines how fiscal centralization influences the likelihood of a successful fiscal adjustment. Using a panel of Swiss cantons from 1981 to 2001, we empirically investigate the determinants of successful long-lasting deficit reductions. Contrary to some results in the literature, we find that fiscal centralization significantly decreases the probability of a successful fiscal consolidation when the contravening effects of competitive and cooperative federalism are disentangled. The results also point to an important role of the economic environment, in particular the size of the primary balance in the years before the consolidation, in determining whether adjustment policy is successful.",are fiscal adjustments less successful in decentralized governments,2009,European Journal of Political Economy,"Christoph A.

"Since 1994, China's central government has implemented a sequence of fiscal recentralization measures to increase its equalization capacity and reduce regional income disparities. However, the effect of intergovernmental transfers on equalization has been called into question by anecdotal evidence that seems to suggest that transfers from the center are not rule-based and are subject to heavy rent-seeking. Unlike past studies, which have focused on the equalization effects of total fiscal transfers from the center, this paper includes an examination of the equalization effects of different types of transfers because some transfers, which are inherently anti-equalizing, may mask the equalization effects of other types of transfers when they are lumped together to find the “average” effect. Using inequality measures, a decomposition of fiscal disparities, and dynamic panel data models, we find that China's intergovernmental transfer system that was established in 1994 does have some equalizing elements. To a large extent, these elements exist due to the mechanism designed to shrink the tax rebates that bear the legacy of the pre-1994 system; to a small extent, these elements exist due to the rule-based general-purpose transfer whose share in total transfers remains small but has increased since 2002. However, the equalization effects of the largest component of transfers, specific-purpose transfers, are anti-equalizing. They are typically not rule-based and thus subject to political influence. As a result, total transfers also exhibit significant anti-equalization effects.",are intergovernmental transfers in china equalizing,2012,China Economic Review,"Bihong Huang1, Kang Chen21University of Macau, 2National University of Singapore",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

After taking account of war-related spending and serial correlation in the data, however, only the World War I and Great Depression ratchets can be clearly identified, and they are closely associated with a major change in the underlying growth rate of government spending early in the 20th century.

We test our hypothesis empirically and find that asymmetric preferences for output stabilization are consistent with how fiscal policy was conducted in a sample of OECD countries during 1987-2005.

"Congress uses varying degrees of specificity when passing legislation. Sometimes it writes very detailed, exacting laws; other times it leaves these details to implementing agencies. A natural positive question then arises: what factors are critical for understanding the degree of delegation used by Congress in a particular circumstance? This paper exploits the tradeoff between the distributive and informational effects of organizational design to examine congressional delegation. We argue that variations in the relative preferences of committee, floor (congressional median voter), and executive actors cause a rational floor voter to choose different forms of collective decision making. We find that homogeneity of committee-floor preferences leads to less delegation, while preference homogeneity between Congress and the executive leads to more delegation. We also argue that delegation emerges when actors are more risk averse or when the uncertainty characterizing the collective choice environment is large.

"Abstract: How do we know whether a country suffers from vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI)? What should be done about it? Academic appreciation of these issues in general, and the nature of political behaviour in particular, both have major implications for the way federations are fiscally structured. While the latter clearly is a problem of political negotiations, our focus is on the former, i.e., conceptual clarity, which precedes meaningful negotiations. Thus, the paper aims to clarify the multiple usages of the symbolically loaded terms VFI and VFG (Vertical Fiscal Gap) by critically engaging the fundamental assumptions and premises underlying these ostensibly similar notions. It proposes an alternative conceptual framework and introduces the concepts of Vertical Fiscal Asymmetry (VFA) and Vertical Fiscal Difference (VFD) that have the potential to better structure public debate on issues of vertical fiscal relations and stimulate a sensible appreciation of the problem and possible remedies.",beyond gaps and imbalances : re-structuring the debate on intergovernmental fiscal relations,2011,NA,Chanchal Kumar Sharma,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",777

To test these propositions, the authors use an original data set to conduct analyses of budget balance and inflation in fifteen federations around the world from 1978 through 1996.

"The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the numerical fiscal rules in force in the 25 countries of the European Union, examines the reasons for the growing appetite for such rules, and assesses whether they have an influence on budgetary developments. The analysis is based on a new dataset constructed from questionnaires submitted to experts in finance ministries of EU countries which report a large amount of information on the numerical fiscal rules in force in the EU countries over the 1990-2005 period. The paper shows that the number of fiscal rules in force in the EU countries has increased in the past decades. The introduction of the Maastricht Treaty and of the SGP seem to have been catalysts for the introduction of fiscal rules. The analysis, based on the estimation of augmented fiscal reaction functions, confirms the existence of a relation between numerical fiscal rules and budgetary developments. The results show that some dimensions matter particularly for the capacity of fiscal rules to influence fiscal policy. Notably, the share of government finances covered by rules and the presence of strong enforcement mechanisms seem to be particularly relevant. The analysis also shows that there is a link between the design of numerical fiscal rules and the stabilisation function of fiscal policy.

"The literature asserts that legislators are unlikely to adopt inefficient policies unanimously. Yet the systematic and unanimous increase in quantities of Total Allowable Catch, under the auspices of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), is inefficient by internationally recognized standards. This article develops a game of distributive politics to explain this puzzle. The game is based on the assumption that specialized Council formations are composed of preference outliers and behave like `runway institutions'. The article shows how, over a period of 16 years, ministers were significantly less concerned with environmental protection, were more supportive of (agri-)fishery issues, and were more right-wing than their governments. The article also tests the conservationist preferences of the European Commission.

"This paper explores the conditions under which legislatures willingly cede, or presidents successfully usurp, the legislature’s institutional power. The theoretical argument builds on the premise that the protection of the legislature’s power requires legislators to cooperate in organizing collective action, and focuses on the distribution of power within the president’s party. The paper analyses the president’s influence on the selection of candidates under different electoral rules. The main insights are: (i) presidents with influence in the nomination of candidates to the legislature can obtain discretionary power by breaking cooperation among legislators; and (ii) presidential discretion is greater under proportional systems. I propose a novel empirical measure of presidential discretion: the degree of detail in budget laws. I analyze an original data set of budget laws for Argentina 1900-2005 and show that: (i) contrary to the conventional wisdom, the Argentine legislature has been an effective check to executive power for most of the century, and (ii) an increase in presidential discretion is associated with the change from plurality to proportional rules in the 1960s.",breaking separation of powers. presidential discretion as a result of competition among districts,2006,NA,Juliana Bambaci1Stanford University,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",781
"In addition to the known effects of government fractionalization, we find that larger deficits are associated with a reduced likelihood of budgetary reforms. In a war of attrition setting, larger deficits signify stronger entitlements on the budget, generating unwillingness to impose self‐discipline.

However, while a crisis creates the opportunity for reform, policy credibility is important for effectively using that opportunity.

"Studies of EU trade policy-making often suggest that delegation of trade authority from the national to the European level strengthened the autonomy of public actors in formulating trade policies. Little empirical research, however, has been undertaken to corroborate this contention. To improve on this situation, I carry out two case studies of the EU's participation in the multilateral trade negotiations known as the Kennedy Round (1964–67) and the Doha Development Agenda (2001 onwards). The analysis reveals that in both cases the EU's negotiating position was largely in line with the demands voiced by economic interests. Although this finding is no proof of economic interests actually determining EU trade policies, it casts some doubt on the autonomy thesis. I also discuss some factors that indicate that interest group influence may be the most plausible explanation for the finding.",bringing economic interests back into the study of eu trade policy-making:,2008,The British Journal of Politics and International Relations,Andreas Dür1University College Dublin,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In comparative political economy, two elements likely to cause fiscal profligacy have received particular attention from researchers: weak budgetary institutions and governmental fragility, especially the fragility related to coalition government. A recent trend in political economy studies integrates both of these aspects, stating that strong budgetary institutions can overcome the tendency of fiscal mismanagement often seen in coalition governments. However, these recent studies have dismissed an important point. Namely, a more rigorous implementation of “interaction effect” analysis might have led to the conclusion that effects of budgetary institutions could weaken under a single party government. Such argument, if it is true, can be contradictory to the results of the pioneering studies in this area, which acknowledged the effectiveness of budgetary institutions in preserving fiscal sanity in the case of a single or nearly single-party government (Hallerberg and von Hagen, in Electoral institutions, cabinet negotiations, and budget deficits in the European union. NBER, pp 209–232, 1999). This paper refutes the hypothesis of ineffectiveness of budgetary institutions on fiscal discipline in the case of a single-party government, by using two additional empirical strategies. One is the adoption of Error Correction Model, used especially for the study of long-run (steady state) effects, taking into full account the particularity of “institutions”. The other strategy involves enlarging the sample. Traditional samples consist of 15 EU countries [e.g. the database of von Hagen and other researchers (Hallerberg et al. in J Polit Econ 23(2):338–359, 2007)]. In this paper the sample was enlarged using the database of Fabrizio and Mody (Econ Polit 22(3):362–391, 2010), which includes East European countries with further addition of 4 more countries (Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand). The resultant sample of 29 countries covers most of the parliamentary democracies among industrial nations. Using this new sample, we found that budgetary institutions are still effective in restraining fiscal mismanagement under a single-party government, but such effectiveness may be weak. However, dividing all the available indices of budgetary institutions into two categories, one being insensitive to the number of governmental parties, the other dependent on this number, enables us to find a clearer effect in the former group even under a single-party government, while the latter category is found to be effective under a coalition government. So far the only explanatory background of the fiscal effectiveness of budgetary institutions was provided by the theory of Common Pool Resources. To make a new classification, we introduced two additional aspects to the theoretical background: one being Time Consistency, and the other being a Multi-Principal Model. A new theoretical classification of budgetary institutions suggests that for single-party governments we should concentrate efforts of budgetary reform to assure Time Consistency. We must have a good numerical fiscal target, top-down budgeting in agenda setting, and only rare use of supplementary budgets. For coalition governments, incomplete contracts concerning the multiparty agreement makes fiscal planning less effective. To overcome this, parliamentary and administrative budgetary procedures should be carefully controlled according to the theory of Common Pool Resources and Multi-Principal Model.",budgetary institutions with or without coalition government: political economy of parliamentary democracies,2019,NA,Makoto Nakanishi1Saga University,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",786
"In this paper, we present a framework for building a firm's issue-specific lobbying strategy. We argue that there are five critical elements of a lobbying strategy and that the major choices concerning political lobbying strategy relate to these elements. The five elements, and the primary strategic choices concerning these elements are: (1) the choice of the level and type of inclusiveness of the strategy; (2) the choice of the form, or forms, of argument to be used in persuading relevant target constituencies; (3) the choice of jurisdictional venue to be addressed; (4) the choice of organizational target that will be engaged and (5) the choice of delivery mode—that is, whether political strategies should be implemented directly by firm managers or outsourced to professional suppliers of these services. We explain these elements in detail. However, in order to engage in a lobbying strategy on a specific issue, the firm must first be able to identify relevant government actions and understand their profitability impact. We show how the strategic logic can be generated by an augmented version of Porter's ‘five forces’ (5F) model (Porter, 1980) that explicitly recognizes the role of government—‘six forces’ analysis.Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",building the firm's political (lobbying) strategy,2005,Journal of Public Affairs,"Aidan R.

"The budget is an expression of political rather than economic priorities. We confirm this proposition for a group of new and potential members of the European Union, finding that politics dominates. The contemporary practice of democracy can increase budget deficits through not only ideological preferences, but also more fragmented government coalitions and higher voter participation. Long-term structural forces, triggered by societal divisions and representative electoral rules, have more ambiguous implications but also appear to increase budget pressures, as others have also found. However, our most robust, and hopeful, finding is that budget institutions – mechanisms and rules of the budget process – that create checks and balances have significant value in curbing fiscal pressures even when the politics is representative but undisciplined, and when long-term structural forces are unfavourable. — Stefania Fabrizio and Ashoka Mody",can budget institutions counteract political indiscipline,2006,Economic Policy,"Stefania Fabrizio1, Ashoka Mody1International Monetary Fund",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"AbstractDistributive spending by a state is often thought to have an electoral connection, and the work on pork-barrel politics whereby spending is geographically targeted is extensive. However, there has been mixed empirical support for the two main hypotheses: (a) that it is targeted at marginal constituencies; or (b) that it goes to party strongholds. Using new data on discretionary sports grant spending in Ireland we offer and test a complementary hypothesis that focuses on the responsible minister as primary decision-maker. We find that the grants are targeted at the responsible minister's constituency. Moreover we test these using three measures of the dependent variable: euro value of the grants, success rate of grant applications and the number of grants allocated per constituency. Our hypothesis is supported in all three models, something we argue gives greater credence to the result.",chieftains delivering: testing different measures of “pork” on an irish data set of discretionary sports grants,2014,"Journal of Elections, Public Opinion & Parties","Jane Suiter1, Eoin O'Malley21School of Communications, DCU, Ireland, 2School of Law and Government, DCU, Ireland",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

We estimate that a dollar spent on preparedness is worth about fifteen dollars in terms of the future damage it mitigates.

"In this paper we analyze the interaction of income and preference heterogeneity in a political economy framework. We ask whether the presence of preference heterogeneity (arising, for example, from different ethnic groups or geographic locations) affects the ability of the poor to extract resources from the rich and, conversely, whether income inequality affects which preferences are given precedence in society. We study the equilibrium of a game in which coalitions of individuals form parties, parties propose platforms, and all individuals vote, with the winning policy chosen by plurality. Political parties are restricted to offering platforms that are credible (in that they belong to the Pareto set of their members). The platforms specify the values of two policy tools: a general redistributive tax which is lump-sum rebated (or used to fund a general public good) and a series of taxes whose revenue is used to fund specific (targeted) goods tailored to particular preferences or localities. Individuals differ both in income and also as to whether they receive utility from some specific good. Our analysis demonstrates that taste conflict first dilutes but later reinforces class interests. When the degree of taste diversity is low, the equilibrium policy is characterized by some amount of general income distribution and some targeted transfers. As a group, however, the poor obtain less income distribution than if taste heterogeneity did not exist. As taste diversity increases in society, the set of equilibrium policies becomes more and more tilted towards special interest groups and against general redistribution. As diversity increases further, however, these policies are not sustainable. There exists a critical threshold of diversity above which the only policy that can emerge supports exclusively general redistribution. In fact, this policy is identical to the one that would be instituted in the absence of any taste diversity at all.",class and tastes: the effects of income and preference heterogeneity on redistribution,2005,NA,"Raquel Fernández1, Gilat Levy21National Bureau of Economic Research, 2London School of Economics and Political Science",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper argues that governments formed as transient, post-election coalit ions of many parties make systematically different policy choices than single -party governments, even though parties large enough to govern alone obviously represent a coalition of interests. The basis of our argument is our claim that parties externalize costs not borne by their support groups. Larger parties represent more groups and therefore internalize more costs. We develop a model to show that even though groups do better if they are represented by large coalition parties, fragmented party systems result of equilibrium choices with proportional representation. The key prediction is that the size of the public sector should be larger, the more parties in government and the more fragmented the party system. These predictions are tested using data from the 1970's-90's in 17 European countries. We find that increasing the number of parties in government and increasing the fragmentation of the party system both substantially increase the fraction of GDP accounted for by government spending. An additional party in government leads to an increase of almost a percentage point of GDP spent in the public sector in by centrist governments. The effect of additional parties in government is more pronounced for right-wing coalitions than for those on the left.",coalition parties versus coalitions of parties: how electoral agency shapes the political logic of costs and benefits,2003,NA,"Kathleen Bawn, Frances McCall Rosenbluth",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper looks at how coalitions function by differentiating between different them based on the kinds of parties involved. Niche parties have strong policy positions and are less concerned about gaining seats while catch-all parties aim to gain seats and are often willing to compromise policy positions to do so. I argue that these differences between parties mean that when catch-all parties in government together, each will need to worry about their coalition partner stealing credit for their achievements. However, niche parties are less able to claim credit for the accomplishments of other groups so these concerns are minimized. I test this idea using budget data from the German states from 1991 to 2010. I look at both overall spending and an issue area strongly subject to credit claiming competition between catch-all parties—individual benefit transfers. I find that overall spending increases under coalitions between catch-all parties but coalitions that include one or more niche parties are not likely to spend significantly more than single party governments. On the other hand, spending on individual benefit transfers decreases the most under coalitions that include only catch-all parties. I argue that these results suggest that parties, when in coalition, focus more on policy issues where they will receive credit and are less inclined to undertake spending that will be reasonably subject to competing credit claiming.",coalition partners and core policy preferences: examining the role of catch-all and niche parties in coalition government *,2014,NA,"Kathryn Wainfan1University of California, Los Angeles",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

This paper first formulates a model of how the politicians in a local government collectively lobby to raise intergovernmental grants to their local government. The model identifies a relationship between council size and grants received. I then study this relationship empirically using the distribution of intergovernmental grants to the Swedish local governments. I use a fuzzy regression-discontinuity design that exploits a council size law to isolate exogenous variation in council size and find a large negative council size effect. This pattern provides indirect evidence for the occurrence of lobbying. The direction of the effect could be explained by free-riding incentives in individual lobbying effort contribution caused by a collective action problem in grant-raising among local government politicians.,collective lobbying in politics: theory and empirical evidence from sweden,2008,Working Paper,Che-Yuan Liang1Uppsala University,Microsoft Academic,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,804

Positive analyses need to account for the various political incentives faced by governments.

"In Norway, as in the other Nordic countries, sector-based policy making in local government is considered a problem as it is alleged to take place at the expense of a more integrated approach. Inspired by American rational choice theories on committee power, this article first sets out to establish whether the distributive rationale of the present committee system actually does promote sector-orientation among local politicians. This approach is challenged by alternative theories on committee power, focusing on the infor- mational rationale in specialisation and the relevance of partisanship. The findings suggest that all the three theories explain in part committee member' preferences, but partisanship is most important for explaining both spending preferences and preferences on organisa- tional forms. The article goes on to explore whether recent local council reforms, intended to replace the sector-oriented system with strong committees by a new de-specialised system with weaker committees, are likely to curb the effect of sector on committee members' pref- erences. The conclusion here is not easy to draw, but it is clear that sector-orientation is not encouraged by the reforms; in fact, the opposite seems to be the case. What local councils may have overlooked, however, is the influence of the informational rationale on commit- tees and their members.

"This paper empirically investigates the interaction of formal and informal political institutions as well as lobbying in determining the ability of agriculture to avoid taxation or attract government transfers. Based on our theory we identify specific interaction effects between district size and characteristic political as well as demographic framework constellation, that determine two different regimes, e.g. an u-shape and an inverse u-shape relation between district size and the level of agricultural protection. Further, our theory implies specific different patterns of how these interaction effects impact on agricultural protection levels in developing and industrialized countries. Using time-series-cross-section (TSCS) data, this paper tackles the quantitative assessment of the theoretical implications. We estimate the latent regime of agricultural protection and assess the opposing quantitative relationships.

"Automobile scrappage programs { tied subsidies oering consumers a credit toward the purchase of a new vehicle with the destruction of their current vehicle { have become a popular short-term stimulus and environmental policy tool implemented by many countries around the world.

The results depend crucially on the distribution of consumer heterogeneity across households and how this heterogeneity interacts with the used car market. In terms of stimulus, environmental, and distributional eects, a comparison of a tied subsidy and a simple subsidy (holding xed government expenditure) is, in general, ambiguous.

"Is there a link between public debt and wealth inequality? Could government bondholders use intra-generational redistribution strategically to make the repayment of debt politically viable? Using a two-generations game-theoretic model, we identify coordination and divide-and-conquer as key factors. By coordinating their bond investments, the old generation may secure a majority favoring debt repayment. As a consequence, coordination mediates the impact of wealth inequality on public debt. Furthermore, ease of coordination offers another compelling reason why declining population growth fosters the accumulation of public debt.

Results also show that hav- ing an extra councilor does not affect the size of the public budget, but in uences its composition. It increases expenditures related to public housing and recreation, which we interpret as items related to clientelis- tic policies.

"This paper examines the factors determining vertical government structures. An empirical analysis for a panel of OECD countries indicates that apart from preferences, economies of scale, and other factors, institutions explain cross-national differences in the degree of fiscal decentralization. Accounting for taxing powers of subnational governments, the evidence strongly supports the collusion hypothesis according to which delegation of decision-making concerning the assignment of powers and national legislation to subnational representatives leads to increased tax centralization, as compared to direct participation of the citizens of the subnational entities. On the other hand, direct democracy at the national level is associated with higher centralization.","costs, preferences, and institutions: an empirical analysis of the determinants of government decentralization",2005,NA,Dan Stegarescu1Center for European Economic Research (ZEW),Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This research examines city council member views toward efforts to direct the benefits of local development policies to certain areas or interests within communities. Using a large national sample of council members, the analysis finds substantial support for the proposition that development should benefit needy areas within a community. Consistent with expectation, minority council members are found to be more supportive of targeting efforts than are Anglo members, and ward representatives appear marginally more supportive of such efforts than do at-large representatives. Partisan affiliation, in general, does not seem to affect those attitudes, but Democratic ward representatives are much more supportive of targeting than either Democratic at-large representatives or Republican council members.

"Employment in the U.S. textile and apparel industries has been declining for more than a quarter of a century. Employment reached its peak in 1973, and since then it has declined by 57 percent in textiles and 63 percent in apparel through March 2002. Total employment also decreased in the steel and automobile industries and in the broader manufacturing sector over the same period. These employment figures from particular industries and a single sector of the U.S. economy might leave the mistaken impression that the entire U.S. economy has been shrinking. On the contrary, this extended period was one of extraordinary prosperity in which total employment in the country grew by 71 percent, worker productivity (including textiles, steel, and autos) grew by 57 percent, and income per capita grew by 72 percent. Declining employment in certain traditional industries did not prevent increasing affluence for the average American. These contradictory employment experiences for textiles, steel, and autos and for the general economy represent the forces of what Joseph Schumpeter (1934) called ""creative destruction."" Innovations that stimulate general economic growth simultaneously destroy specific jobs as emerging technologies replace older technologies. Creative destruction has gotten more attention recently because it is a major component of globalization, and many prominent job losses have been attributed to import competition. During this period 1.5 million jobs were destroyed in textiles and apparel, but total employment in the economy grew. For each textile job eliminated, 36 more jobs were created in other industries. Employment in the U.S. steel industry declined by 361,000 during the period, but more jobs were created elsewhere. The new jobs created did not all require the same skills or have the same location as the old jobs, and workers had to acquire new skills and migrate to new locations to get new jobs. At the same time textile employment was falling in the major textile producing state of North Carolina, there was a large net migration to the state from other states and from other countries. Many workers entered occupations that did not exist previously and produced newly invented goods. Some displaced workers with poor alternatives had to accept lower wages in their new jobs, but wages and productivity for the average worker increased substantially. For each $1 lost by workers who were hurt, other workers gained more than $1. Goods became more abundant and income per person rose precisely because less labor was necessary to produce each unit. Wages of unskilled workers did fall relative to those of skilled workers, but this change in relative wages revealed new information about the increase in demand for skilled workers, and it provided a powerful signal to unskilled workers about the payoff from acquiring additional skills. Merely counting the number of jobs destroyed in an industry without also taking account of the additional goods made possible by an innovation can be very misleading about the effects of economic changes. It confuses means (jobs) and ends (goods and services). For example, automatic dishwashers do the work that could have been done by workers using their hands. Is the destruction of millions of hours of hand dishwashing jobs a tragedy? In periods of rapid innovation, such as the recent episode of globalization, economic growth accelerates, but so does the rate of destruction of certain jobs and creation of other jobs (Caballero and Hammour 2000). Simply adding up the number of jobs destroyed misses the benefits from accelerated economic growth. Politicians and the popular press focus their attention on jobs destroyed or jobs threatened by economic change, but this emphasis on ""destruction"" of old jobs misleads the public about the ""creative"" aspect of creative destruction and its contribution to economic growth. Policies that protect traditional jobs and technologies from innovation interfere with enhancement of worker productivity that contributes to better jobs and higher income. …",creative destruction and globalization,2003,Cato Journal,Thomas Grennes,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper claims that special purpose independent agencies such as quangos provide an avenue for understanding the personal vote and political control of administrative policymaking in Britain. Quangos make policies that directly influence particularistic concerns in an MP's constituency, generating incentives for MPs to meddle with their independence in order to capture the personal vote. A division of labor within the governing party relies on backbench MPs to sound fire alarms (McCubbins and Schwartz 1984) when their constituents find fault with quango activities. Once the alarms are sounded, the government has the incentive to manipulate quangos' independence, for example, by making their decisionmaking transparent to provide information for the fire alarm mechanism in the future. This manipulation draws from the government's stock of political capital gained from a supportive electorate. Statistical analysis of transparency in British executive non-departmental public bodies from 2002-2005, suggests that increases in backbench salience (personal vote) and public satisfaction with government (government strength) increase the transparency by which quangos make decisions, thus decreasing their independence. Public satisfaction with the status quo of public service provision, by contrast, decreases transparency, increasing independence. These results suggest that far from being independent, quasigovernmental organizations are subject to political control.","credible governance? transparency, political control, the personal vote and british quangos",2008,Political Studies,Anthony M.

"This article analyses how the presence of a dominant group of voters within the electorate affects voter turnout. Theoretically, we argue that both the absolute size and the relative power of a dominant group influence voters' decision-making process. The former effect derives from increased free-riding incentives and reduced social pressure to vote within a larger dominant group, while the latter effect is driven by instrumental and expressive responses-in both the dominant and dominated groups-to electoral competition between groups. Our empirical analysis of a large cross-section of German municipalities confirms this joint importance of a dominant group's absolute and relative size for voter turnout. Such effects should thus be taken into account when redesigning electoral jurisdictions through, for instance, municipal mergers or gerrymandering.","david and goliath in the poll booth: group size, voting power and voter turnout",2019,Local Government Studies,"Peter Bönisch1, Benny Geys2, Claus Michelsen31Zalando SE, Berlin, Germany, 2BI Norwegian Business School, 3German Institute for Economic Research",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This chapter formulates a common pool model of fiscal policy-making including both countercyclical and productive spending motives to run deficits, and derives key principles for the optimal design of fiscal restraints. The model is then used to evaluate the welfare and design aspects of fiscal rules and delegation, with a view to the special cases of the recently amended Stability and Growth Pact and national fiscal councils. We find that simple numerical fiscal rules are prone to cause pro-cyclicality and to suppress productive public spending projects in the presence of a deficit bias. The amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact introduced in 2005 are helpful in this respect. National fiscal councils generally satisfy the principles for optimal deficit restraint, but neither councils nor rules are enough to ensure an optimal fiscal outcome, even if optimally conditioned on economic circumstances. Both arrangements must be combined with a budgetary institution allowing for productive public investments and spending projects to take precedence in the budget process.",dealing with the deficit bias: principles and policies,2009,NA,"Signe Krogstrup, Charles Wyplosz",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Even though the link between decentralization and economic performance has been subject to a large bulk of empirical studies, so far no clear-cut conclusions prevail. This may be due to the fact that it is not fiscal federalism per se but rather particular features of federalism’s institutional design that determine its impact on economic progress. In this paper, the empirical analysis on the influence of fiscal federalism on productivity in the German states from 1975 to 2005 does not only consider expenditure and revenue decentralization, but also includes intergovernmental transfers. The evidence suggests that revenue decentralization is favorable to economic performance, whereas expenditure decentralization has a negative impact on economic performance.

"The objectives of the present paper are twofold. First, we aim to synthesize the two strands of the literature on the incentive effect of intergovernmental transfers, the decentralized leadership and the soft budget problem both of which address the discretionary nature of the central transfer policy. We develop a simple decentralized leadership model in which the local governments move first and the central government transfer scheme is decided made ex post. The ex post discretion by transfer by the central government pursuing social welfare distorts the ex ante incentive of the local governments, inducing the strategic action of the latter government. This paper also shows that the direction of the ex ante distortion moral hazard problem relies on what decision is made ex ante by type of authority is given to the local government, namely public expenditure or tax collection ex ante. Second we examine the robustness of the incentive problem. The model is extended in several directions, incorporating spillover effects of public expenditure, tax competition and goods and distortionary taxes. The essence of the incentive problem remains.",decentralized leadership meets soft budget,2005,NA,"Nobuo Akai1, Motohiro SatoUniversity of Hyogo",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"According to the Leviathan-Model, fiscal federalism is seen as a binding constraint on a revenue-maximizing government. The competitive pressure of fiscal federalism is supposed to reduce public sector size as compared to unitary states. However, empirical results concerning the Leviathan hypothesis are mixed. This study uses a state and local-level panel data set of Swiss cantons from 1980 to 1998 to empirically analyze the effect of different federalist institutions on the size and structure of government revenue. Because of the considerable tax autonomy of sub-national Swiss governments, it is possible to investigate different mechanisms by which fiscal federalism may influence government size. The results indicate that tax exporting has a revenue expanding effect whereas tax competition favors a smaller size of government. Fragmentation has essentially no effect on the size of government revenue for Swiss cantons. The overall effect of revenue decentralization leads to fewer tax revenue but higher user charges. Thus, revenue decentralization favors a smaller size of government revenue and shifts government revenue from taxes to user charges.",decentralized taxation and the size of government: evidence from swiss state and local governments,2010,Southern Economic Journal,"Lars P.

Although there are both theoretical and anecdotal reasons to believe in the existence of such benefits, previous empirical work has largely failed to verify the connection between pork barreling and reelection. We ex amine House incumbents during the 1980s, when budget deficits were allegedly forcing legislators to end the acquisition of distributive benefits, and we discover that legislators did in fact reap electoral benefits from pork barreling in the 1980s. We further discover that there is a sharp partisan difference in the marginal effects of federal outlays: additional federal monies strongly affect Democratic reelection margins but barely impact the electoral fortunes of Republicans.

"Benefit-cost analysis is required for many regulatory decisions in the United States and in other countries. In this paper, I examine a standard textbook model that is used in benefit-cost analysis as it is actually applied to environmental policy and other areas of regulation. My primary objective is to suggest how including some key factors in the analysis could promote the development of smarter regulation.I begin by presenting a standard economic model for government intervention in markets, which balances benefits and a narrow definition of costs. I then introduce a richer normative theory that considers several political and economic costs that are frequently not considered in analyzing real-world applications. Examples include costs associated with rent seeking, design and implementation, and raising revenues. The richer theory suggests that the government should supply less of a good, or ask the private sector to provide less of that good, than the standard economic model suggests. The reason is that intervening in markets is often more costly than the standard model assumes. In special cases, the theory provides guidance on the setting of socially optimal taxes and subsidies. I then explore how the theory needs to be modified in the presence of biased estimates of benefits and costs. I conclude with a discussion of how the theoretical framework can be applied to the actual design of regulatory policy.",designing smarter regulation with improved benefit-cost analysis,2010,Journal of Benefit-cost Analysis,Robert W.

"""This paper explores the role of political institutions in determining the ability of agriculture to avoid taxation in developing countries or attract government transfers in industrialized countries. The utilized model is based on a probabilistic voting environment, wherein rural districts are less ideologically committed than urban districts in industrialized countries, and the reverse is true in developing countries. As a consequence, in industrialized (developing) countries rural (urban) districts are pivotal in determining the coalition that obtains a majority, whereas urban (rural) districts are pivotal within the majority itself. In bargaining at the level of the legislature, this generates a conflict between a government that tends to favor rural (urban) districts, and a parliamentary majority that is dominated by urban (rural) concerns. As district size grows and the electoral system converges to a purely proportional system, both of these biases are attenuated. Overall, we see opposing nonlinear relationships between district size and agricultural subsidies on the one hand and district size and taxation on the other. In developing countries, taxation of agriculture first increases and then decreases with district magnitude; in industrialized countries, agricultural subsidization first increases and then decreases with district magnitude. Moreover, the impact of district magnitude on the level of agricultural subsidization is attenuated in presidential versus parliamentary systems, while the level of agricultural taxation is amplified in presidential systems.

"How can a constituency continue to receive targeted benefits even without a representative in the legislature? We provide a theoretical model to demonstrate why constituency groups linked to specific candidates would receive politicized government transfers even when the group loses its representative in the legislature. The model also suggests that the amount of transfers a group with a representative receives is increasing in the probability that the group can secure a legislative seat in next election. We test this claim using the changes in Japanese central-to-municipality transfers after a representative passes away while in office. We find that electorally “strong” constituency groups do not lose transfers when they lose their representatives. However, when “weak” constituency groups lose their representatives the transfers decrease by roughly 9 percent.",direct and indirect representation1,2008,NA,"Shigeo Hirano1, Michael M.

"This paper exploits the introduction of the right of referenda at the local level in the German state of Bavaria in 1995 to study the fiscal effects of direct democracy. In the first part of the paper, we establish the relationship between referenda activity and fiscal performance by using a new dataset containing information on all 2500 voter initiatives between 1995 to 2011. This selection on observables approach, however, suffers from obvious endogeneity problems in this application. The main part of the paper exploits population dependent discontinuities in the signature and quorum requirements of referenda to implement a regression discontinuity design (RDD). To safeguard against co-treatments that might affect fiscal outcomes simultaneously at the same thresholds, we validate our results by extending the RDD approach to a difference-in-discontinuity (DiD) design. By studying direct legislation in an archetypical cooperative federation as Germany, our paper extends the literature to a novel institutional setting. The results indicate that in our setting - and in contrast to most of the evidence from Switzerland and the US - direct democracy causes an expansion of local government budgets.",direct democracy and local public finances under cooperative federalism,2017,The Scandinavian Journal of Economics,"Zareh Asatryan1, Thushyanthan Baskaran2, Theocharis Grigoriadis3, Friedrich Heinemann41ZEW Mannheim DE‐68161 Mannheim Germany, 2University of Göttingen, 3Free University of Berlin, 4ZEW Mannheim Mannheim Germany",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"One of the most robust empirical findings about direct democracy is that US states with the voter initiative tax and spend significantly less than states without the initiative, at least since the mid-1970s. The fiscal differential between initiative states and non-initiative states has been interpreted as an indication that voters prefer smaller government than legislators. Yet, existing research has not explained exactly which elements of the public budget are cut as a result of the initiative. This paper does so. I find that the major fiscal effect of the initiative is not smaller government in general, but specifically the effect is lesser and more unequal education funding. In particular, the overall spending differential in initiative states is due primarily to reductions in state aid to school districts for elementary and secondary education. Local governments do not compensate for the lost state aid through increases in revenue from other sources. Therefore, because state funding of education is a progressive force that works toward equalizing school spending, initiative states also experience significantly higher levels of inequality across districts in per pupil spending. I discuss implications of these results for the understanding of direct democracy and its effects on the relationship between voters and politicians.",direct democracy and redistribution,2009,NA,Christopher R.

"Governments are responsible for administrative arrangements dealing with disasters. Effective policies play a vital role in mitigating the impact of disasters and reducing likely losses of life and property. Yet, it had been noted that such losses were increasing, raising questions about efficacy of government policies and the factors that made them effective. This study adopted a comparative method, responding to a long-standing demand of disaster research, for examining the record in India. There were noticeable differences among its states, with some having undertaken comprehensive reform in an all-hazards approach, while others continued with old policies. This research studied four states with the objective of identifying variables that were critical in undertaking policy reform for building capacities. The roles of economic resources, democratically decentralized institutions, political party systems and focusing events were examined. Findings revealed that these factors had varying impact on state capabilities. Economic resources were an inevitable part of disaster management, but did not necessarily translate into policy reform. Panchayati Raj Institutions, which were democratically decentralized bodies, displayed tremendous potential. However, their role was limited mostly to the response phase, with states severely circumscribing their involvement. The nature of political party systems was able to explain policy reform to an extent. Cohesive systems in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Orissa correlated with administrative capacities, unlike in fragmented Bihar. However, anti-incumbency sentiments and strong community mobilization impacted contestation more than electoral salience of public goods. The most nuanced and significant explanation was provided by experience of focusing events. States that suffered major disasters revealed unmistakable evidence of double-loop learning, leading to comprehensive policy reform and capacity building. This research provides empirical support to theory about the role of focusing events and organizational learning in policy reform. Methodologically, it underscores the importance of the comparative approach, and its successful application in a federal framework. The significance of this research is most for policy makers and practitioners, as it serves to alert them on the need for reform without waiting for the next big disaster to catch them unprepared.

"Distributive politics models often predict that legislators will demand inefficiently large projects, with inefficiency increasing in the number of districts, and that this will translate into larger projects and higher spending. The relationship between efficiency and legislature size is often referred to as the “law of 1/n”(Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen 1981). We demonstrate that the “law of 1/n” result with respect to project sizes and total spending is dependent on several factors, including the type of good being provided, the costs of raising revenue, and whether the local government has to share in the project's cost with the central government. In general, the “law of 1/n” need not hold for total government spending, and in fact a “reverse law of 1/n” often holds. In light of our theoretical findings, we reassess the empirical literature on this topic. The results have implications for a wide variety of applications in American and comparative politics.",distributive politics and the law of 1/n*,2008,The Journal of Politics,"David M.

"The author considers the overspending bias in legislatures when the benefits of public policies are concentrated in particular districts but the costs of financing them are spread over the entire political jurisdiction. He formalizes this idea in a simple theoretic framework, in the context of externalities between districts. His main prediction is that greater districting leads to bigger government, but the effects are mitigated if there are positive spillovers of government spending between districts. Institutional forms of government that concentrate decision-making power can curtail the overspending bias. He presents evidence on these predictions from a cross section of U.S. city governments. His main findings are that: 1) If we take an average city, keep its population and other characteristics constant, but divide it into a greater number of political districts, we get substantially greater government spending per capita. 2) Greater jurisdictional heterogeneity and income equality are associated with bigger government. 3) At-large electoral systems are not less sensitive to overspending than district electoral systems are. 4) Strong-mayor forms of city government, especially those in which mayors have veto power, can curtail the overspending bias. These findings are robust to controlling for socioeconomic characteristics of cities and to alternative measures of government size.","districts, spillovers, and government overspending",1999,Working Paper,Reza Baqir,Microsoft Academic,Final,Paper was included,849
"The number of parties in government is usually considered to increase spending. We show that this is not necessarily the case. Using a new method to detect close election outcomes in multi-party systems, we isolate truly exogenous variation in the type of government.

"We evaluate the eect of relaxing fiscal rules on budget outcomes in a quasi-experimental setup. In 1999, the Italian central government introduced fiscal rules—also known as the Domestic Stability Pact—aimed at imposing fiscal discipline on municipal governments, and in 2001 the Pact was relaxed for municipalities below 5,000 inhabitants. This institutional change allows us to implement a “dierence-in-dis continuities” design by combining the before/after with the discontinuous policy variation. Our estimates show that relaxing fiscal rules triggers a substantial deficit bias, captured by a shift from zero deficit to a deficit that amounts to 2% of total budget. The adjustment mostly involves revenues as unconstrained municipalities cut their real estate and income taxation. The impact is larger when mayors can run for reelection and the number of political parties is high. A falsification test in 1999 shows that our findings are not driven by the fact that cities just below and above 5,000 are dierentially aected by fiscal rules.",do fiscal rules matter? a dierence-in-disc ontinuities design,2011,NA,"Veronica Grembi, Tommaso Nannicini, Ugo Troiano1Harvard University",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

As governors’ electoral security increases, their willingness to support legislatively desired localized spending increases.

We use an instrumental variables approach that helps isolate the fiscal consequences of house price appreciation by taking advantage of the influence of local topological constraints on the elasticity of house prices with respect to interest rates. Our analysis generates three main findings. First, despite Prop 13 fiscal constraints, rapid house price appreciation has a strong effect on property tax revenue. Second, the resulting increase in property tax revenue was largely offset by a reduction in other local tax revenue.

"A large literature on the ‘flypaper effect’ examines how federal grants to states at time period t affect state spending (or taxes) at time period t. We explore the fundamentally different question of how federal grants at time period t affect state tax policy in the future. Federal grants often result in states creating new programs and hiring new employees, and when the federal funding is discontinued, these new state programs must either be discontinued or financed through increases in state own source taxes. Government programs tend to be difficult to cut, as goes Milton Friedman’s famous quote about nothing being as permanent as a temporary government program, suggesting that it is likely that temporary federal grants create permanent (future) ratchets in state taxes. Far from being purely an academic question, this argument is why South Carolina’s Governor Mark Sanford attempted to turn down federal stimulus monies for his state. We examine both the impact of federal grants on future state budgets and how federal and state grants affect future local government budgets. Our findings confirm that grants indeed result in future state and local tax increases of roughly 40 cents for every dollar in grant money received in prior years.",do intergovernmental grants create ratchets in state and local taxes,2014,Public Choice,"Russell S.

"The fiscal commons problem is one of the most prominent explanations of excessive spending and indebtedness in political economics. The more fragmented a government, the higher its spending, deficits and debt. In this paper we investigate to what extent this problem can be mitigated by different fiscal or constitutional institutions.

Theoretically, they both describe the degree to which the costs of spending decisions are internalized by individual decision-makers. In addition, we evaluate whether constitutional rules for executive and legislation as well as budget rules shape the size of government and how the different rules interact with fragmentation in determining government size. The empirical study of the role of fragmented governments for fiscal policy outcomes is based on a panel of the 26 Swiss cantons over the 1980-1998 period.

"Recently several countries have experienced a drop in popularity of national political parties, accompanied by the success of independent movements (e.g. Civic Lists in Italy). I exploit the success of Civic Lists in Italian municipalities and use them as a comparison group for party-affiliated politicians, to test whether national parties affect fiscal discipline. In particular, using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), I show that party-affiliated mayors are more fiscally responsible: they run lower deficits, accumulate less debt and reduce expenditures. The effect is significant only for municipalities not constrained by fiscal rules. This suggests that national parties act as a substitute for fiscal rules in constraining politicians. Besides that, I provide evidence that the discipline of party-affiliated politicians is linked to better career prospects: party-affiliated mayors have a higher probability of being re-elected and better chances of being promoted to higher levels of government.

"A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments' discretionary spending cast ballots for the incumbent party in larger proportions than those not receiving funds. But contrary to most theories of political accountability, the evidence seems to indicate that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing ``programmatic'' spending legislation, over which incumbents have no discretion, and even when passed with support from all major parties. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that will cost them votes. We address this puzzle with one of the largest randomized social experiments ever, resulting in clear rejection of the claim, at least in this context, that programmatic policies greatly increase voter support for incumbents. We also reanalyze the study cited as claiming the strongest support for the electoral effects of programmatic policies, which is also a very large scale randomized experiment. We show that its key results vanish after correcting either a simple coding error affecting only two observations or highly unconventional data analysis procedures (or both). We discuss how these consistent empirical results from the only two probative experiments on this question may be reconciled with several observational and theoretical studies touching on similar questions in other contexts.",do nonpartisan programmatic policies have partisan electoral effects? evidence from two large scale randomized experiments,2019,The Journal of Politics,"Kosuke Imai1, Gary King2, Carlos Velasco Rivera1Princeton University, 2Harvard University",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",865

"Even though Finland has proportional elections, single-party control in Finnish local councils is not uncommon contrary to what one might expect. The largest party holds more than half of the seats in every third Finnish local council and is thus likely to govern alone. This study investigates whether single-party and coalition governed municipalities differ in their economic outcomes. Common pool models predict that when there is a governing coalition, all the parties aim to target some spending at their core constituents, while costs are shared equally across all parties. This would mean that coalition governments result in higher spending. Using data from 445 Finnish municipalities for the years 1980â€“2010, I provide causal evidence that is consistent with the predictions of common pool models. Estimates suggest that single-party control decreases total expenditures and revenues by around 200â€“300 euros per capita.

"Scholars of state politics are often interested in the causal effects of legislative institutions on policy outcomes. For example, during the 1990s a number of states adopted term limits for state legislators. Advocates of term limits argued that this institutional reform would alter state policy in a number of ways, including limiting state expenditures. We highlight a number of research design issues that complicate attempts to estimate the effect of institutions on state outcomes by addressing the question of term limits and spending. In particular, we focus on (1) treatment effect heterogeneity and (2) the suitability of nonterm-limit states as good counterfactuals for term-limit states. We compare two different identification strategies to deal with these issues: differences-in-differences (DID) estimation and conditioning on prior outcomes with an emphasis on synthetic case control. Using more rigorous methods of causal inference, we find little evidence that term limits affect state spending.

"Are fiscal programs larger or smaller if they are run centrally, rather than locally, in a prospective federation. We abstract completely from well-understood economic issues and focus instead on the political effects of centralization. For fiscal programs with benefits broadly spread in the population - such as redistributive transfer schemes, social insurance and general government consumption - centralization changes the coalition of voters who favor a large program in a direction that depends on the nature of the redistributive instrument. For fiscal programs with localized benefits-such as provision of local public goods - centralization creates opportunities for rent-seeking, which increases the size of government.",does centralization increase the size of government,1994,European Economic Review,"Torsten Persson1, Guido Tabellini21Stockholm University, 2University of Brescia",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In many countries, local governments operating on a small scale face a choice between amalgamation and cooperation. This paper applies a novel methodology to investigate the implications of this choice for operating efficiency. Using a unique micro-level dataset of over 11,000 loans made to both municipalities and intermunicipal organizations in the Netherlands, we show that the latter consistently pay higher interest rates than the former. That is remarkable, because credit risk is zero in both cases, and we control for loan characteristics like amortization and maturity. In contrast, municipal amalgamation does not result in higher interest rates. Possible legal or administrative costs associated with enforcing loan guarantees cannot explain the higher interest paid by intermunicipal organizations. That is because we find that public companies (which may default) do not pay higher interest rates than public bodies (which never default). Surprisingly, the number of partners cooperating in an intermunicipal organization does not affect interest rates. Thus, we find no evidence for the","does intermunicipal cooperation create inefficiency? a comparison of interest rates paid by intermunicipal organizations, amalgamated municipalities and not recently amalgamated municipalities",2015,SOM Research Reports,"Maarten Allers1, Bernard van Ommeren2, Bieuwe Geertsema1SOM EEF, 2BNG Bank",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Despite important differences across states, when considered together, the results show that senators serving two years abstain more often, introduce fewer bills, and do not seem to be more responsive to their constituents than senators serving four years.

We also deal with those aspects related to sample heterogeneity and the sensitivity of the results to different possible definitions of fiscal adjustment. We find evidence that the probability of ending a period of fiscal consolidation depends on the debt level, the magnitude of the adjustment, the extent of expenditure cuts, and the degree of cabinet fragmentation.

Based on a theoretical framework, the empirical panel analysis relates the degree of public sector decentralization to economic and European integration, controlling for inter-regional heterogeneity, economies of scale, and institutions.

Financial depth, income inequality, assassinations, cabinet size, and centralization of authority in budgetary decisions are found to be significant and robust determinants of public deficits. We also propose a working hypothesis and provide supporting econometric evidence: Social polarization is important in explaining differences in fiscal outcomes across countries, yet its effects may be even more pronounced or suppressed, depending on the political and institutional structures through which social polarization is linked to the fiscal policy-making process. Indeed, effects on public deficits of the sociopolitical variables tend to be smaller in countries with better institutional arrangements. Conversely, the sociopolitical polarization has very strong effects on deficits in the presence of poor institutions. The results are confirmed by extensive robustness tests such as the sensitivity analysis and the robust estimation method.","economic, political and institutional determinants of public deficits",2003,Journal of Public EconomicsSocial Science Research Network,"Jaejoon Woo1, 2DePaul University, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",878

"Analysis of the contribution of education to growth through its role in promoting a common culture indicates that when different cultural groups separately determine the social content of their school curricula excessive polarization can result, with less than optimal growth. The optimal trajectory involves a gradual, reciprocal convergence of school curricula towards the middle ground. This may be difficult to implement in a political context in which all agents are identified with one group or another.

"Empirical research on the causal effect of government fragmentation derives diverse results. One reason for this diversity might be that studies are typically settled in a variety of institutional environments. To assess the extent to which the local political system might shape the effects of fragmentation, this study measures the causal effect of a change in the nomination scheme of the city manager on the council size effect. I combine a regression discontinuity design with a difference-in-differences approach in a large panel dataset of German municipalities. The study finds that when the manager is appointed by council, there is no significant council size effect, but that there is a negative effect when the manager is elected by voters for those expenditure categories over which the manager has the most discretion.

"Local public good provision from different government levels is subject to many bias coming from the political process; incentives indeed, vary with the size of the beneficiaries’ set and costs may affect the results of political competition by reducing total resources available for redistribution. Present work represents a first attempt to look at these issues together; indeed, it considers the situation where politicians have a finite budget to use both for redistributive policies and for the provision of a public good that affects the utility of a fraction of the electorate. In this setting it is not enough that benefits balance costs, in order for the public good to be implemented; the required level of efficiency moreover, is influenced by benefits concentration. If those interested in the public good are less than half of the electorate, concentration increases the efficiency threshold; on the contrary if they amount for more, benefits concentration decreases the required level of efficiency.

"Theory provides many explanations about the influence of electoral rules on politicians’ equilibrium behavior. With a few exceptions, all models agree that majoritarian elections are associated with more targeted redistribution and lower politicians’ rents than proportional representation. To sidestep the identification problems of previous empirical studies based on country-level data, we test these hypotheses using micro data for the mixed-member Italian House of Representatives. In particular, we address the nonrandom selection into different electoral systems by exploiting a particular feature of the Italian two-tier elections from 1994 to 2006: candidates could run for both the majoritarian and the proportional tier, but if they won in both tiers they had to accept the majoritarian seat. Focusing on elections decided by a narrow margin allows us to generate quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of the electoral rule.

"Microeconomic theory can serve at least two useful functions in the development of a coherent theory of political economy. First, the logic of individual choice is developed in detail. Second, microeconomic theory may provide a useful framework for the analysis of the economic interests of social actors. While the formal theory of social choice has received considerable development in political science, there is considerably less research explicitly endogenizing political decisions. This paper examines a recent body of research by economists which does attempt to link rational choice with explicit assumptions about economic interests in an attempt to endogenize tariff policy. It is suggested that this line of research is potentially fruitful, but that greater attention needs to be given to the institutional assumptions on both the demand and supply sides of the market for political outputs.",endogenous tariff theory: a critical survey*,1988,American Journal of Political Science,Douglas Nelson,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"If people understand that some macroeconomic policies are unsustainable, why would they vote for them in the .first place? We develop a political economy theory of the endogenous emergence of fiscal crises, based on the idea that the adjustment mechanism to a crisis favors some social groups, that may be induced ex-ante to vote in favor of policies that are more likely to lead to a crisis. People are entitled to a certain level of a publicly provided good, which may be rationed in times of crises. After voting on that level, society votes on the extend to which it will be financed by debt. Under bad enough macro shocks, a crisis arises: taxes are set at their maximum but despite that some agents do not get their entitlement. Some social groups do better in this rationing process than others. We show that public debt .which makes crises more likely .is higher, as is the probability of a crisis, the greater the level of favoritism. If the favored group is important enough to be pivotal when society votes on the entitlement level, favoritism also leads to greater public expenditure. We show that the favored group may strategically favor a weaker state in order to make crises more frequent. Finally, the decisive voter when choosing expenditure may be different from the one when voting on debt. In such a case, constitutional limits on debt may raise the utility of all the poor, relative to the equilibrium outcome absent such limits.",engineering crises: favoritism and strategic fiscal indiscipline,2017,NA,"Gilles Saint-Paul1, 2, Davide Ticchi3, Andrea Vindigni41Paris School of Economics, 2New York University Abu Dhabi, 3Marche Polytechnic University, 4University of Genoa",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",888

The results show that New Zealand sought to achieve aggregate fiscal discipline and enhance technical efficiency through formal mechanisms for transparency and accountability.

"Excise taxes represent a small, but not insignificant, source of tax revenue in the United States. Federal excise taxes make up about 6.6 percent of all federal taxes, state excise taxes make up about 16 percent of all State taxes, and local excise taxes are about three percent of all local taxes. Aggregating across governments, excise taxes are about eight percent of total taxes in the United States.1 Public finance theory offers several justifications for relying on excise taxes, and this chapter offers a critical assessment of the standard public finance analysis of excise tax policy. One fundamental problem with the standard public finance approach to excise taxation is that it does not consider the political environment within which excise taxes are created. This is a problem with the economic analysis of taxation in general, but the political environment creates more problems for excise taxation than for other types of taxes, for several reasons. After considering the problems that interest group politics raises for the application of excise taxes, the chapter then discusses optimal excise tax policy in light of the political environment of excise taxation. The chapter concludes that in general, excise taxes should be avoided, but that they may be justified in certain narrow cases where the revenues from the tax clearly finance a benefit targeted to those who pay the tax.",excise taxation and interest group politics,2002,NA,Randall G.

We distinguish four groups of aggregate variables as potential determinants of satisfaction: political, economic, institutional, and human development and culture. We use ordered probit to investigate the importance of these variables on individual life satisfaction and test the robustness of our results with Extreme Bounds Analysis. The results show that only a small number of factors, such as openness, business climate, postcommunism, the number of chambers in parliament, Christian majority, and infant mortality robustly influence life satisfaction across countries while the importance of many variables suggested in the previous literature is not confirmed. This remains largely true when the analysis splits national populations according to gender, income and political orientation also.",exploring different determinants across groups in society,2006,NA,"Christian Bjørnskov, Axel Dreher",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Inspired by current European developments, we study equilibrium fiscal policy under alternative constitutional arrangements in a `federation' of countries. There are two levels of government: local and federal. Local policy redistributes across individuals and affects the probability of aggregate shocks, while federal policy shares international risk. Policies are chosen under majority rule. There is a moral-hazard problem: federal risk-sharing can induce local governments to enact policies that increase local risk. We investigate this incentive problem under alternative fiscal constitutions. In particular, we contrast a `horizontally-ordered' federal system like the United States (in which the federal government deals directly with individuals) with a `vertically-ordered' system like the EC (in which the federal government deals with national states). These alternative arrangements are not neutral, in the sense that they create different incentives for policy-makers and voters, and give rise to different political equilibria. A general conclusion is that centralization of functions and power can be welfare improving under appropriate institutions. This conclusion only applies, however, to the moral-hazard problem and a federation where the countries are not too dissimilar.",federal fiscal constitutions. part i: risk sharing and moral hazard,1992,NA,"Torsten Persson, Guido Tabellini",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Federal and state governments often differ in the capacity to pre-commit to expenditure and tax policy. Whether the implied sequence of public decisions has any efficiency implications is the subject of this paper. We resort to a setting which contrary to most of the literature does not exhibit a perfect tax-base overlap. We show that a federal government's pre-commitment capacity is welfare-improving. Efficiency, however, does not improve over all decision margins. The welfare-increasing policy entails a more distorted level of public consumption. Moreover, welfare may also improve if local governments are able to pre-commit towards the upper level. The rationale is that although federal transfers are formally unconditional they nevertheless entail a tax-price effect; thereby potentially counteracting incentives to engage in a ""race to the bottom"" in fiscal competition among local governments.",federal tax-transfer policy and intergovernmental pre-commitment,2008,Regional Science and Urban Economics,Marko Koethenbuerger1Center for Economic Studies,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We analyze federal systems of government in which local public policies are financed by general taxation. In a decentralized political system there is, in each region, a vote to elect a local representative while in a centralized political system a single representative is elected by a federal vote. It is shown that under decentralization, voters strategically elect liberal representatives so as to nullify any element of cooperation between representatives in the decision-making stage. Thus, there is a trade-off between the budgetary externality and a “policy closer to the people”, but the democratic choice is biased towards decentralization.

"The fiscal constitution governs the federal system and thus the competition among member states. In Switzerland tax competence and spending decisions are highly decentralised. In order to make such as system operational an intergovernmental transfer system is needed. Today it does not work in a satisfactory manner, however. In particular, the autonomy of the cantons is in danger. Therefore, the federal government and the cantons have commonly decided to launch an ambitious reform programme.

"Purpose - The latest generation of research into macroeconomic policy has turned from more technical aspects of optimal control and expectations formation to consideration of the policymaking institutions themselves. More and more countries have moved towards greater degrees of central bank independence, including many developing economies as well the member countries of the European Central Bank. What still is not generally settled among economists is how to measure the stance of policy and the institutional features of the policymaking process. The purpose of this paper is to assess prevailing monetary and fiscal policies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of a review encompassing many different measurements of policy stance and policymaking processes. The authors begin with monetary policy followed by an analysis of central bank institutions. The next sections turn to fiscal policy and the need to adjust budget balance for the state of the business cycle. There is then a brief concluding section. Findings - The authors show in this review that fiscal and monetary rules, and economists' understanding of them, have changed substantially over the years. While on one level there is greater consensus, there have been new questions raised in the process that leave plenty of room for further ongoing research in these key policy areas as well as the optimal design of the design of the monetary and fiscal institutions concerned. Originality/value - The paper provides a review of the existing literature updated and applied with reference to recent events, including the global financial crisis.",fiscal and monetary institutions and policies: onward and upward?,2011,Journal of Financial Economic Policy,"Richard C.K.

"This paper reviews Korean intergovernmental relations in the 1990s with an emphasis on fiscal relations among the different levels of the government. In the 1990s, Korea reinvigorated its system of local autonomy first established in the sixties. A major issue in the implementation of this system is the presence of vertical and horizontal disparities in local fiscal capacity. Although some efforts have been made to transfer tax sources from central government to local governments or establish local transfer (block grants), fiscal autonomy still remains below expectation, jeopardizing the realization of full local autonomy. This paper is an effort to look into these issues and search for solutions.",fiscal autonomy of korean local governments and intergovernmental relations in the 1990s,2003,"Journal of Public Budgeting, Accounting & Financial Management","Pan S.

"Why does budgetary balance vary over time within the same country? And what causes the balance to vary over a group of countries at a certain time? A rapidly growing body of positive political economy offers explanations to these questions.87 Until the early nineties, however, fiscal constitutions were largely overlooked as determinants of fiscal discipline.88 This may seem odd, since it has long been known that in strategic models of budgeting, equilibrium behavior is typically non-robust to changes in the rules of the game. That is to say, rules seem to matter at least in theory.89","fiscal constitutions, fiscal preferences, information and deficits: an evaluation of 13 west-european countries 1978 – 95",2000,NA,Leif Helland1University of Oslo,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",914
"The virtues of fiscal decentralisation are usually assessed against the provision of local public goods, little is said about its impact on public finances. There is, however, a growing concern that central governments losing control over part of the budget could negatively affect public finances, especially in times of adverse financial conditions. The present work shows that these concerns are misplaced. The empirical investigation on 19 OECD countries, over the period 1980-2010, shows that expenditure decentralisation improves the central budget balance without prejudice for local budgets, thus improving the overall country’s fiscal position. This effect is reinforced when combined with tax autonomy. During periods of financial crises, the disciplinary role of fiscal decentralisation appears to be even stronger, raising concerns about the recentralisation trend recently pursued by some advanced economies precisely to face fiscal distress and economic stagnation.",fiscal decentralisation in times of financial crises,2018,CESifo Economic Studies,"David Bartolini1, Agnese Sacchi2, Simone Salotti3, Raffaella Santolini41Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2Sapienza University of Rome, 3Joint Research Centre (JRC) Seville, European Commission, 4Department of Economics and Social Sciences, Polytechnic University of Marche, P.le Martelli, 8, Ancona, Italy",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Although the region remains highly centralized, the tendency toward decentralization is quite strong. Not only is a larger portion of the general government budget executed from the subnational government level, the autonomy that these governments have in deciding how much to spend and what to spend on is increasing as well.

"In many parts of the world, lower levels of government are taking over responsibilities from national authorities. This often leads to difficulty in maintaining fiscal discipline. So-called soft budget constraints allow these subnational governments to expand expenditures without facing the full cost. Until now, however, there has been little understanding of how decentralization leads to large fiscal deficits and macroeconomic instability. This book, based on a research project at the World Bank, develops an analytical framework for considering the issues related to soft budget constraints, including the institutions, history, and policies that drive expectations for bailouts among subnational governments. It examines fiscal, financial, political, and land market mechanisms for subnational discipline in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Norway, South Africa, Ukraine, and the United States. The book concludes that the dichotomy between market and hierarchical mechanisms is false. Most countries--and virtually all developing countries--must rely on market mechanisms as well as hierarchical constraints to maintain fiscal discipline. When bailouts cannot be avoided, they present important opportunities to reform underlying institutions. Successful market discipline--where voluntary lenders perform important monitoring functions--is most likely to emerge from a gradual process that begins with carefully crafted rules and oversight.",fiscal decentralization and the challenge of hard budget constraints,2003,NA,"Jonathan A.

"The literature on public choice has largely argued that when several actors are part of a decision-making process, the results will be biased towards overspending. However, the empirical studies of the effect of minorities and coalition governments on spending have yielded mixed support for this theoretical claim. This chapter argues that the inconclusiveness of the empirical evidence is related to problems of standard regression models to accurately capture unobserved heterogeneity. We use data from Spanish municipalities for the period 2004–2011 to compare the results of four typically used estimation methods: mean comparison, OLS, fixed-effects regression and matching. We argue that out of these models, matching deals better with unobserved heterogeneity and selection bias of the type of government, allowing us to reduce estimating error. The results show that, when we account for these problems in a matching model, minorities run lower surpluses than single party majorities. This result did not arise in simple mean comparisons or OLS models, or even in the fixed-effects specification. These results give support to the law of 1/n (Weingast, Journal of Political Economy 96: 132–163, 1981) and also underscore that in order to identify correctly the impact of government characteristics on policy-making, we need to understand that these are not randomly assigned across our units of observation. This advises the use of more quasi-experimental methods in our empirical research.",fiscal deficits and type of government: a study of spanish local elections,2015,book chapter,"Joaquín Artés1, Ignacio Jurado21Complutense University of Madrid, 2University of York",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper compares the fiscal behavior of states with and without the voter initiative over the last thirty years. The main finding is that total spending was significantly lower in initiative states than in noninitiative states. Local spending was higher and state spending was lower in initiative states. On the revenue side, initiative states relied less on broad-based taxes and more on charges tied to services. Taken together, the evidence indicates that the initiative leads to a reduction in the overall size of government and suggests that it causes a decline in the level of redistributional activity.

"We reconsider Svensson’s inflation-targeting proposal in a model where the need to raise seigniorage revenues determines the socially optimal inflation rate and distortionary taxes cause the inflation bias. Interpreting the targets as contracts, we show that the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy complicates the structure of the optimal contract. Moreover, if the commitment technology is imperfect, “highish” targets generate lower inflation than targets which are too low to be credible. Then we turn to an interpretation of inflation targets as monetary policy delegation to a nondistortionary, target-conservative agent. In our model target-conservative bankers are public-expenditure conservative. Expenditure-conservatism may explain why central bank independence is orthogonal to output variability.",fiscal policy and imperfectly credible targets: should we appoint expenditure-conservative central bankers?,1997,NA,"Marco Lossani1, Piergiovanna Natale1, Patrizio Tirelli21University of Milan, 2University of Glasgow",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper explores how public spending responds to changes in the business cycle. We develop a political economy explanation of pro-cyclical spending where deviations from the optimal policy are a function of endogenous time horizons which, in turn, result from redistributive motivations that vary depending on the characteristics of the ruling coalition. We explore the plausibility of the argument using data on government spending in Argentina over one hundred years of history. Given the structure of the data we fit an error-correction model and estimate the short-term elasticity of government spending to the business cycle while controlling for the long-term relationship between both series. We find preliminary support to the political economy explanation: while governments of all shades run pro-cyclical fiscal policies, the elasticity of public spending to the business cycle is greater under the Peronist, a party representing a coalition of urban workers and industrialists, and traditional sectors in the provinces. Alternative explanations based on ideology, institutions and external conditions seem to play a lesser role. ∗Prepared for the Conference “Understanding the institutional trajectory of Latin American development,” London School of Economics and Political Science, London, September 27-28, 2012.The information and views expressed in this article are those of the authors, and do not represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, the Federal Reserve System, the Inter-American Development Bank, its Board of Executive Directors, or the countries represented by the IADB Directors. †Inter-American Development Bank; e-mail: martina@iadb.org ‡Columbia University; e-mail: pp2162@columbia.edu §The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; e-mail: Santiago.Pinto@rich.frb.org",fiscal policy in good times and bad times: endogenous time horizons and pro-cyclical spending,2019,NA,"Mart́ın Ardanaz1, Pablo M.

"When considering the implications for fiscal-policy outcomes (especially deficits and debts) of the dispersion of policymaking authority across multiple actors, recent veto-actor scholarship has emphasized its potential to privilege the status quo and thus retard policy-adjustment rates. In similar contexts, however, others have stressed collective-action and common-pool issues that arise when multiple policymakers share authority over policies. Still others have highlighted the bargaining and compromise aspects of policymaking with multiple actors. This paper offers a synthetic discussion of these multifarious effects of the number and diversity of policymaking actors, thereby placing veto-actor considerations in broader theoretical context, and it offers an empirical approach to modeling these manifold effects distinctly and effectively. It then offers an initial exploration of this synthetic-theoretical and structured-empirical approach in a substantively important policy context: the evolution of fiscal policy in developed democracies from the 1950s through the 1990s.",fiscal policy with multiple policymakers: veto actors and deadlock; collective action and common pools; bargaining and compromise,2008,NA,Robert J.

"Fiscal rules are mentioned as instruments to commit political actors on long-term fiscal sustainability. However, fiscal rules may have stronger effects on projected than on realized fiscal outcomes because of window-dressing measures or because they alter the bargaining situation in the budget process. In our analysis for Swiss cantons, fiscal rules significantly lower the probability of projected and realized deficits with the former effect being twice as large. Projections are generally over-pessimistic but fiscal rules increase the probability of accurate projections.

"Against the commonly accepted view that in the run-up to EMU the Maastricht fiscal restraints were quite effective in re-aligning public finances in Member States that were showing large excessive deficits, Strauch and von Hagen stress that there are some objections concerning this initial sign of institutional effectiveness. They note that the restraining effect is much less apparent in the early stages of the post-1992 period for some larger countries. Moreover, some countries might have consolidated their public finance position even without the Maastricht fiscal criteria, given their debt level and the macro-economic environment. The authors argue that formal fiscal restraints may be an effective instrument for avoiding excessive deficits, provided they incorporate certain institutional features: the fiscal target must be clear-cut and comprehensive, enforcement should rely on independent agents, and the formal restraints involved should be difficult to amend. They find that EMU fiscal rules show some weaknesses with respect to these guidelines. The authors also stress that the budget process can be an effective instrument for solving the problem posed by a “deficit and spending bias” in public finance. In their opinion this holds also if strict fiscal rules already exist.",formal fiscal restraints and budget processes as solutions to a deficit and spending bias in public finances: us experience and possible lessons for emu,2001,NA,"Rolf R.

The first, productive efficiency , relates to the maximization of outputs over inputs; the second, allocative efficiency , refers to the match between the demand for services and their supply; the third, distributive efficiency , relates to the pattern of service delivery amongst different groups of citizens; while the fourth, dynamic efficiency , refers to the balance between current and future consumption.

"Amalgamation offers municipalities an incentive to free ride when they can subrogate the load onto the newly created municipality after amalgamation. However, the doubt about whether the merged municipalities were really selected at random remains, especially in the case of voluntary amalgamation. Moreover, the pre-merger municipality’s debt accumulation or public spending expansion before amalgamation cannot be confirmed as free-rider behavior because these municipalities might have only developed the infrastructure in preparation for the amalgamation. Based on the foregoing, this study divides pre-merger municipalities into two groups: those that had the chance to free ride when setting the long-term care insurance premium and those that did not. Moreover, it focuses on the revision of the long-term care insurance premium as the target of free-rider behavior. The regression results confirm that only pre-merger municipalities that formed amalgamation committees before FY2003 and approved amalgamation after FY2003 showed free-rider behavior. These municipalities revised the long-term care insurance premium lower than never-merged and pre-merger municipalities that formed amalgamation committees and approved amalgamation after FY2003.",free‐rider behaviour under voluntary amalgamation: the case of setting the long‐term care insurance premium in japan,2018,NA,Katsuyoshi Nakazawa1Toyo University,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Ethno-regional voting cleavages have featured in a number of sub-Saharan African states during the third wave of democratization following the end of the Cold War.While the causes and consequences of these cleavages are well studied, there have been surprisingly few attempts to understand how strategies of pan-ethnic or pan-regional coalition building based on distributive economic policies could be employed to secure national electoral coalitions. In this paper we examine if in the 2009 Malawian parliamentary elections the newly-formed national party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), led by the President Binguwa Mutharika used its incumbent position to promote an economic policy based on food security in order to overcome traditional ethno-regional voting patterns and win a nationwide electoral majority. After presenting a formal model of a optimal allocation of an economic resource to overcome ethnic bias and induce vote-switching, we use district-level data in a system of equations to analyze if strategic allocation within the national fertilizer subsidy program contributed to the nation-wide electoral victory of the DPP.",from the great lakes to the great rift valley: does strategic economic policy explain the 2009 malawi election?,2014,NA,"Samuel Brazys1, Peter Heaney, Patrick Paul WalshUniversity College Dublin",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

We examine the political institutions and budgetary processes that can affect fiscal policy in Pakistan. A sound fiscal policy feeds bond market development, while the bond market provides signals in relation to the prudent conduct of fiscal policy. A common dimension in this mutual relationship is the governance environment. The article concludes that instilling fiscal discipline will remain intractable unless approached comprehensively. Long-term solutions must be found in the development of political institutions and improved governance. An active and liquid bond market can play a crucial role in bringing about fiscal discipline.

"Using a panel of budgetary data over the period 1989-1996, we analyse how political fragmentation of Flemish local governments affects their reactions in the context of a major reform of the grant system. This reform reallocated grants among municipalities and thus unavoidably created ""winners"" and ""losers"". Thus, it is possible to distinguish between political reactions in good and bad times. The presence of a balanced budget requirement implies that in bad times municipalities have to react whereas in good times the decision to react is endogenous to the government. The results are in line with the hypotheses, if not the findings, of Kontopoulos and Perotti (1999) in that we find that fragmentation is important both in good and in bad times. Coalition size - the number of political parties - plays a crucial role when the budgetary shock is endogenous (in ""good times"" when grants increase). In this case, we find that more-party governments spend more of the additional funds. On the other hand, cabinet size - the number of spending ministers (aldermen) - is the relevant dimension of fragmentation when the reaction is exogenous (in ""bad times""). When grants are cut back, expenditures are cut back more in municipalities with fewer ministers.

Having one or the other is likely to affect economic outcomes in ways that are unintended when the electoral rules are approved. In this paper, we show that government fragmentation has large fiscal implications. We also provide results that have a causal interpretation. Using a panel of Spanish municipalities, along with a close-elections regression discontinuity design, we find that single-party majorities run budgets with a 1.5% point larger primary surplus than that of coalitions. In addition, we show that lower deficits are driven mainly by single-party majority governments’ capacity to raise more revenues.

fragmentation in decision making as a determinant of fiscal outcomes.
In very broad terms, fragmentation arises when several agents or groups
participate in the fiscal decision-making process, each with its own interests
and constituency to satisfy, and each with some weight in the final decision.
To participate in the majority, each group demands a share in the budget; as all
groups do this, the end result is a high level of expenditure or a large deficit",government fragmentation and fiscal policy outcomes: evidence from oecd countries,1999,NA,"Yianos Kontopoulos, Roberto Perotti",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",941
"We consider a bargaining model of the interaction between a government and interest groups in which, unlike existing models, neither side is assumed to have all the bargaining power. The government will then find it optimal to constrain itself in the use of transfer policies to improve its bargaining position. In a model of redistribution to lobbies, the government will find it optimal to cap the size of lump-sum transfers it makes below the unconstrained equilibrium level. One implication is that with the optimal cap on efficient subsidies in place, less efficient subsidies will be used for redistribution even when they serve no economic function. We thus offer an alternative theory that explains why governments may optimally choose to restrict efficient lump-sum transfers to interest groups and partially replace them with relatively less efficient transfers.",government gains from self-restraint: a bargaining theory of inefficient redistribution,2004,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Allan Drazen1, Nuno Limão21National Bureau of Economic Research, 2University of Maryland, College Park",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

We find that when the tax burden is heavier for taxpayers at the top of the income distribution and lighter for taxpayers at the bottom of the income distribution, state and local government expenditures grow, and governments spend more on social welfare.

"The relationship between income distribution and economic growth has long been an important economic research subject. Despite substantial evidence on the negative impact on long-term growth of inequality in the literature, however, there is not much consensus on the specific channels through which inequality affects growth. The empirical validity of two most prominent political economy channels - redistributive fiscal spending and taxes, and sociopolitical instability - has recently been challenged. We advance a new political economy channel for the negative link between inequality and growth, a fiscal policy volatility channel, and present strong supporting econometric evidence in a large sample of countries over the period of 1960-2000. Our finding also sheds light on another commonly observed negative relation between macroeconomic volatility and growth. We carefully address the robustness of the results in terms of data, estimation methods, outlier problem, and endogeneity problem that often plague the standard OLS (ordinary least squares) regression.","growth, income distribution, and fiscal policy volatility ∗",2011,Journal of Development Economics,"Jaejoon Woo1, 2DePaul University, International Monetary Fund",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Why are U.S. congressmen reluctant to support gun control regulations, despite the fact that most Americans are in favor of them? We argue that re-election motives can help explain why politicians often take a pro-gun stance against the interests of the majority of the electorate. We describe a model in which an incumbent politician must decide on a primary issue, which is more important to a majority of voters, and a secondary issue, which a minority cares more intensely about. We derive conditions under which the politician, when approaching re-election, will pander towards the interests of the minority on the secondary issue. To assess the evidence, we exploit the staggered structure of the U.S. Senate in which one third of members face re-election every two years and examine senators' voting behavior on gun control. In line with the model's predictions, we obtain three main results: senators are more likely to vote pro gun when they are closer to facing re-election; this behavior is driven by Democratic senators, who ""flip flop"" on gun control; election proximity has no impact on the voting behavior of senators who are retiring or hold safe seats.",guns and votes,2013,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Laurent Bouton1, Paola Conconi2, Francisco Pino2, Maurizio Zanardi31Georgetown University, 2Université libre de Bruxelles, 3Lancaster University",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Using a new data set on Swiss cantons since 1890, we analyze how the adoption of proportional representation affects fiscal policy. In line with economic theory, we show that proportional systems shift spending toward broad goods (like education and welfare benefits) but decrease spending on geographically targetable goods (like roads). We find little evidence that proportional representation increases the overall size of government. An analysis of the underlying theoretical mechanisms reveals that proportional representation increases electoral turnout, left-wing representation and political fragmentation. These changes in political representation explain a substantial share of the rise in education spending, but a small share of the rise in welfare spending or the decline in road expenditures.

"Using a new data set on Swiss state and local governments from 1890 to today, we analyze how the adoption of proportional representation affects fiscal policy. We show that proportional systems shift spending toward broad goods (e.g. education and welfare benefits) but decrease spending on targetable goods (e.g. roads and agricultural subsidies). Our evidence does not suggest that proportional representation increases the overall size of government. We provide new evidence on the mechanism behind these estimates. We show that proportional elections lead to better political representation of left-wing parties, which are associated with more spending. Furthermore, proportional elections lead to higher political fragmentation. However, since political fragmentation increases spending in a plurality system only, proportional elections reduce spending through its more moderate effects of fractionalized parliaments.","how do electoral systems affect fiscal policy? evidence from state and local governments, 1890 to 2005",2010,NA,"Patricia Funk1, Christina Gathmann21University of Lugano, 2Center for Economic Studies",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Concerns that interest groups use their financial resources to distort the democratic process are longstanding. Empirical research shows that interest groups seek access to legislators through their campaign contributions, but the literature is limited in its focus on direct access to relevant committee members in a static institutional environment. If interest groups value committees, we argue, then they should also value indirect access, that is, access to those who make committee assignments and to those who set the procedural rules of the legislature. We collect a new dataset on U.S. state legislative committee assignments from 1988–2014, merged with campaign finance data, in order to analyze over 300,000 candidate-committee observations across 99 legislatures. Using a difference-in-differences design based on changes in individual legislators’ positions in the legislature, we show that interest groups value direct access to policy relevant committees, but we also show that they value indirect access. When a legislator gains procedural powers, interest groups reallocate considerable amounts of money to her. We take advantage of the institutional variation in the U.S. states to validate this indirect access hypothesis in several additional ways. Taken together, the results reveal how interest groups in a wide range of democratic settings seek to influence the policy process not only by seeking direct access to policymakers but by seeking indirect access to legislative procedure as well.",how do interest groups seek access to committees,2018,American Journal of Political Science,"Alexander Fouirnaies1, Andrew B.

"In this paper, we highlight the link between the political demand and social policy outcome while taking into account the design of the party system. The political demand is measured by indivudual preferences and the design of the party system is defined as the extent of party fractionalization. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt in the literature to empirically link the political demand and the policy outcome with the help of a direct measure of preferences. Moreover, we account for an additional channel, so far neglected in the literature : The composition effect of the demand. Indeed, the heterogeneity of the demand within countries, more than the level of the demand itself, is shown to have a positive impact on welfare state generosity. This impact increases with the degree of fractionalization of the party system.

This article empirically analyzes voluntary municipal mergers in Finland. Our main focus is on aspects that have been somewhat neglected in prior empirical work: whether local democracy considerations, representation and voter preferences are involved in shaping the resulting municipal structure. The main results imply that some municipalities are forced to merge due to fiscal pressure and have to trade off political power to be accepted by their partners. The study also finds that the median voter's distance from services matters, while population size does not.

To uncover the effects of strategic mimicking behavior among neighboring municipalities, we exploit the fact that insurance tax levels sharply dropped when municipalities experienced municipal amalgamation during the Great Heisei Amalgamation, which took place during the mid-2000s. Utilizing the incidence of neighbor amalgamation as an instrumental variable, we investigate how insurance tax levels in neighbor municipalities affect tax levels in non-amalgamated municipalities. Results suggest that there has been significant mimicking behavior in non-amalgamated municipalities whose insurance tax levels were higher than those of their neighbors before the Great Heisei Amalgamation. The other non-amalgamated municipalities have not responded to changes in neighbor insurance tax levels.

"The traditional view of public finance attributes three major goals to the management of public finance: stabilization, reallocation, and redistribution.2 It is the inter-relationships between these that give rise to the major issues in public finance. For instance, provision of public educational services through the levying of taxation affects real income distribution, while distributional activities inevitably affect relative prices and consumer demands, and therefore the allocation of resources to the production of various goods. Of these interrelationships, there is perhaps no more crucial question for public finance than the following: How can society collectively determine the optimal amount of public goods, and how shall the costs of these goods be apportioned among individuals (Due and Friedlaender, 1973, p. 48)? The scope of this chapter is, first, to acknowledge the contribution that the answering of this question can have for the goal of stabilization through management of the aggregate fiscal position, but mainly to examine the specific mechanisms that can assist improving allocative efficiency through public budgeting.",improving allocative efficiency,2007,NA,Jim Brumby,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper examines how the concentration of special interest groups affects the placement and success of controversial facilities. It argues that authorities site public bads - nuclear power plants, dams, and airports - in locations where, especially in the long term, there are fewer pressure groups who oppose such facilities and more who support them. The presence of powerful politicians and worsening first sector employment increase the likelihood that a public bad will be placed in a locality. The placement of an initial public bad in an area overcomes an opposition threshold and makes additional sitings far easier than 'greenfields' siting attempts. Using a new dataset on Japan involving approximately 500 observations of villages and towns over the post war period, this paper reveals that special interest groups become more involved in facilities associated with higher levels of risk and that non-political factors, such as higher population density and smaller town size, only occasionally demonstrate exclusionary effects.","in my back yard, please: an analysis of the siting and success of public bads in japan",2004,NA,Daniel P.

"Many efficient policies imply short-term costs while the benefits accrue to voters later. Often voters cannot motivate politicians to invest in such down-up policies by their reelection decision. Adding a further incentive element to the reelection mechanism, however, can solve the underinvestment problem.

"Predicting available tax revenue accurately is a key step of fiscal policy. It has recently been shown that revenue projection errors have a direct impact on fiscal deficits. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the ideology of the finance minister and tax revenue projection errors, and assess how the stringency of fiscal rules alters this relationship. We use a panel dataset of 26 Swiss cantons over the period 1980–2007 as well as a new dataset of 99 finance ministers at the cantonal level. Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that the allocation of the departments – including the department of finance – to the elected politicians is a random process from the point of view of the voters. We identify a rather counter-intuitive positive effect of the ideology of the finance minister on tax revenue projection errors in the sense that a more left-wing finance minister produces relatively more conservative forecasts. We also find that fiscal rules reduce the effect of ideology on tax revenue projection errors. These results suggest that left-wing finance ministers need to curb deficits relatively more in order to signal the same level of competence to the voters than right-wing finance ministers. They also suggest that fiscal rules render the signal less informative to the voters and thereby reduce the incentive for left-wing finance ministers to be more conservative in their projections.",incentive effects of fiscal rules on the finance minister's behaviour: evidence from revenue projections in swiss cantons,2015,European Journal of Political Economy,Florian Chatagny1ETH Zurich,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper investigates the issue of political feasibility of a road pricing policies (RPP). Referring to a literature developed in international trade theory (Fernandez and Rodrick, 1991), this paper presents a model regarding the role and relevance of individual specific uncertainty in explaining the political acceptability of RPP. It is shown that: a) without money transfers, i.e., reimbursements of the tax levied, and with no uncertainty, RPP might not be accepted thus giving rise to an evident trade-off between economic efficiency and political acceptability; b) when individual specific uncertainty is assumed, optimal level of RPP, may, under given conditions concerning the number of voters and people preferences, become politically acceptable. Two different strategies can be envisaged to render RPP politically feasible: gradual and radical. The first strategy foresees a low corrective tax that eliminates only a small proportion of the excessive use of the public good and provides an acceptable balance between monetary loss and environment improvement. Alternatively, a radical strategy would foresee a much higher level of tax substantially reducing the number of people consuming the public good and providing a potentially higher and concentrated payoff to those still consuming it after the policy is implemented. This latter policy appears more easily sustainable under majority than unanimity voting.",individual uncertainty and the political acceptability of road pricing policies,2002,NA,"Edoardo Marcucci1, Marco A.

"Predictions of various models of public sector supply rely on the assumption of bureau monopoly power. This assumption is tested first by measuring industrial structure of the federal public sector using the concentration ratio and Herfindahl index, and second by examing the relationship between the resulting estimates and bureau monopoly power. The findings indicate that monopoly structure of the federal bureaucracy is more limited than is generally assumed. Interpretations on the basis of traditional industrial organization theory and contestable market theory suggest that bureau monopoly power is questionable and may not be the source of observed inefficiencies in bureau supply.

"This paper develops an infinite horizon model of public spending and taxation in which policy decisions are determined by legislative bargaining. The policy space incorporates both productive and distributive public spending and distortionary taxation. The productive spending is investing in a public good that benefits all citizens (e.g., national defense or air quality) and the distributive spending is district-specific transfers (e.g., pork barrel spending). Investment in the public good creates a dynamic linkage across policy-making periods. The analysis explores the dynamics of legislative policy choices, focusing on the efficiency of the steady state level of taxation and allocation of tax revenues. The model sheds new light on the efficiency of legislative policy-making and has a number of novel positive implications.",inefficiency in legislative policy-making: a dynamic analysis,2005,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Marco Battaglini1, Stephen Coate21Princeton University, 2National Bureau of Economic Research",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",967
"This thesis is concerned with the role of Inflation Targeting (IT) and Fiscal Rules (FRs), as well as of their interactions, on macroeconomic environment. After laying the conceptual and empirical backgrounds of both these rules-Based policy frameworks (Chapter 1), the dissertation highlights new evidence on their macroeconomic consequences. First, IT adoption does help attracting more Foreign Direct Investment into Developing Countries (Chapter 2). Second, inthese countries, IT adoption provides strong incentives for governments to undertake reforms designed to improve the quality of institutions (Chapter 3). Third, the introduction of national-Level numerical FRs does stand as a credible remedy against fiscal indiscipline in these countries, all the more in politically stable economies and where the numberof FRs in place is important. But this discipline-Enhancing effect of FRs decreases with the time length since their adoption, and is weakened in the presence of supranational rules and in countries with more fragmented government. Interestingly, this effect varies with the type of rules: while Budget Balance Rules and Expenditure Rules have significant disciplineenhancing effects, the effect of Debt Rules proved not significantly different from zero (Chapter 4). The last three chapters of the thesis focus on the role of the interaction between IT and FRs, and to a broader extent, on the interplay between monetary and fiscal authorities. The first result that emerges is that IT, which is a framework for conducting monetary policy, proves also sufficiently binding for fiscal authorities to providing them with strong incentives for improving fiscal discipline, notably in developing countries (Chapter 5). In addition, on the one hand, IT and FRs act complementarily, as adopting both IT and FRs leads to better results in terms of running fiscal surpluses and in terms of bringing down average inflation than adopting only one of these two frameworks. On the other hand, the sequence which consists of introducing FRs first before adopting IT yields better inflationary and fiscal performances than the opposite sequence (Chapter 6). Finally, better Policy Mix coherence, that is, better coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, is conducive to higher economic growth in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (Chapter 7).",inflation targeting and fiscal rules in developing countries : interactions and macroeconomic consequences,2012,NA,René Tapsoba1Centre d'Études et de Recherches sur le Développement International,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The growth of government spending has been an issue of concern among policymakers and academics in most OECD countries since the 1970s. The political economy literature has pointed toward the importance of the budget process for the budgeting behavior of policy-makers. The present study wants to contribute to this ongoing debate by providing evidence from the U.S. states. In doing so, it combines theoretical arguments about the institutionally induced spending bias in budgetary decision-making and the information asymmetries between actors. The theoretical basis for my understanding of budget institutions is the assumption that budget decisions bear a common-pool resource (CPR) problem. When the incentives inherent in the CPR problem prevail in the budget process, policy-makers do not internalize the entire social costs of spending. Following this line of reasoning, the study argues that budget procedures restricting policy-makers' bias to furnish excessive resources to their constituencies lead to lower expenditures. The second element of the conceptualization is the information asymmetry existing between policy-makers and agency-heads. From Niskanen onward it has been argued that this information asymmetry allows bureaucrats to maintain overproduction and/or inefficiencies in the supply of public services. Correspondingly, information generating mechanisms should overcome spending bias.",information and public spending: an empirical study of budget processes in the us states,2000,NA,Rolf Strauch1University of Bonn,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",969
"This paper reconsiders the analogy between competitive markets and the political process that is central to much of the literature on the efficiency of government transfers. The key problem is that property rights in politics are much less well defined than they are in competitive markets. As the paper outlines, obtaining accurate information about the benefits and costs of transfers is likely to be much more difficult than envisioned in the literature. Investigators, as well as general voters, often must rely on the government and competing parties for provision of information about underlying program parameters and functional relationships. We argue that politicians and the affected interest groups have incentives to limit and distort the information that is released to voters and that political competition is unlikely to be an effective counter. In developing the argument, a theoretical framework is provided and applied in a case study of the ethanol transfer. The documented efforts to disguise the actual costs and benefits of the program are important for gaining a broader understanding of the functioning and costs of government transfers in the economy.",information distortion and competitive remedies in government transfer programs: the case of ethanol,2001,Economics of Governance,"Ronald N.

" The purpose of the paper is to study the connection between technological progress on the one hand, and systems of economic governance, on the other hand. A simple model of economic governance is introduced, deriving the functional capacity of social structures to carry out technological progress from their capacity to appropriate capital. That capacity is grounded both in efficiency and legitimation. That broad theoretical frame is applied to the coexistence of constitutional states and other forms of economic governance. Empirical evidence indicates that constitutional states are losing their capacity to appropriate capital. Additional, contextual evidence suggests two other patterns of social change. On the one hand, demographic growth is slowing down. On the other hand, absorption of innovation in the global economy, back in the past strongly correlated with the fiscal intervention of governments, presently seems to have disconnected from the economic power of constitutional states.

"The issues of cyclical majorities and instability of collective choices have been in the forefront in the discussion of social choice mechanisms. Cycling, lack of equilibria, and so called chaos theorems have been prevalent in the public choice literature.

However, cycling has not been made quantifiable nor has it been clear how one would determine empirically whether majorities are cyclical. In this paper, cycling has been given an empirical meaning.

"This article examines how the institutional characteristics of state legislatures and governors affect state policy priorities. We argue that differences in the nature of their respective constituencies lead legislators to press for particularized benefits while governors favor collective goods. Empirical analysis of state-level data from 1982 through 2011 confirms that this is the case. The organizational arrangements of the two branches of government have an impact that is usually greater than that of state public opinion but generally less than that of state interest groups. The results from this analysis are important because they show that institutional structure has systematic effects that are independent of ideology, partisanship, and the other factors that are known to shape state policy making.",institutional characteristics and state policy priorities the impact of legislatures and governors,2015,State Politics & Policy Quarterly,"Daniel C.

"The literature on political economy analyses of agricultural protection mainly focus on the impact of economic and demographic structures on the level of agricultural protection (Tyers/Anderson 1992, Swinnen 1994, Rausser et al. 1974), although it is commonly accepted that beyond economic and demographic structures political institutions do have an impact on the political power of different interest groups and hence on agricultural policy output (Gardner 1987 as well as Binswanger et al. 1997). The impact of political institutions, e.g. the organization of legislature, election and party systems, on agricultural protection has hardly been taken into account explicitly in theoretical and empirical studies, yet. In this framework the paper investigates to what extent political institutions explain observed variances in the political power of the agrarian population in the ten Central and Eastern European Countries/Candidates (CEEC) applying for an accession of the EU. Moreover, it is analyzed to what extent EU-accession will be politically feasible given the specific political and economic framework conditions of the individual states. In particular, empirical analyses imply the following results: (i) the political power of the agrarian population varies significantly among the analyzed countries ranging from a relative low political weight of 0.115 of the agrarian population in Lativa up to an absolute political dominance of the agrarian population in Slovenia given a weight of 0.887. (ii) The political weights are significantly determined by political institutions. In particular, the more the election systems corresponds to a proportional representation and the more the parliamentary organization allows for a specialized representation of agrarian interests, e.g. bicameralism where a second chamber representing regional interests, and the more efficient the organization of agrarian interests, e.g. existence of a peasent party, the higher is the political weight of the agrarian population. (iii) Analyzing to what extent EU-accession is politically feasible in the CEEC-states we can show that, assuming national financing of EU-policy, EU-accession would be hardly politically feasible in any CEEC-countries. An exception might be seen in Slovenia. Thus political feasibility of EU-accession crucially depends on keeping the rule of financial solidarity. Moreover, assuming a comprehensive pre-accession CAP-reform will take place, possible options to achieve political feasibility in the CEEC-states under these conditions would be undertaking constitutional reforms. In particular, the implementation of electorate system corresponding closer to a proportional representation or the establishment of bicameralism would be, at least theoretically, possible options.",institutional foundation of agricultural protection: the case of eu-accession and agricultural policy in eastern european countries,2002,NA,"Christian H.C.A.

"This paper investigates the factors explaining significant policy change by studying how bipartisan support developed to sustain the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) of 1934. The RTAA fundamentally transformed both the process and outcome of U.S. trade policy: Congress delegated its authority over tariff-setting to the president sharply toward trade liberalization. The durability of this change was achieved only when the Republicans, long-time supporters of high tariffs who originally vowed to repeal the RTAA, began to support this Democratic initiative in the 1940s. In seeking to explain this conversion, we find little evidence of an ideological shift among Republicans, but rather an increased sensitivity to export interests for which the institutional structure of the RTAA itself may have been responsible. Our results suggest that analyzing changes in both institutional incentives and economic interests are important for understanding lasting change in economic policy.","interests, institutions, and ideology in the republican conversion to trade liberalization, 1934-1945",1997,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Douglas A.

"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency cost of transfers. To this end, we develop a model of individual demand decisions about the provision of a regional public good that encompasses a continuum of tax–transfer scenarios to finance regional public expenditure. We assume that individuals have identical quasi-linear preferences defined over private consumption and the regional public good, that endowment income varies between individuals and regions, and that regions have different predetermined sizes. In an economy-wide resource constrained framework we show that, despite its simplicity, this model is capable of discriminating the efficiency properties of the different scenarios considered, and that the substitution of matching transfers for own-regional taxes always raises the provision of the regional public good, despite the resource-constrained nature of the exercise. The model allows very easily the analysis of equalising transfers, which we show to be distorting only when a matching element is present. We also find that, when transfers have a matching element, ‘fiscal illusion’ increases the elasticity of public good provision with respect to transfers, and suggest a potentially refutable hypothesis to identify the existence of this phenomenon.

"Local government economics and finance have traditionally been thought of solely in terms of revenue and expenditure structures. We argue that performance monitoring needs to be considered as a legitimate and critical third element of local government finance scholarship.

We then turn our attention to the other side of the ledger—expenditure—where we also commence our study with a survey of current practice. The scholarly literature in Australia has largely focused on an exhaustive debate regarding whether economies of scale do, or do not, exist. We review the debate and conclude that most of the literature suffers from methodological deficiencies. Moreover, we argue that it is time to shift the debate to an examination of more promising avenues for constraining municipal expenditure . Finally, we build a case for the importance of performance monitoring for addressing the corrosive effects of information asymmetry, providing an account of local government stewardship, and for the purposes of public policy intelligence.

"Economic literature has provided a wide range of analyses on how taxes, government spending and budget balances should be set over the cycle in order to ensure sound and sustainable fiscal policies. However, recent economic history has shown that fiscal policy often departs from what could be considered optimal.

The causes for the deficit and pro-cyclical biases have been extensively researched in the literature.

By comparing different organizations of committee structure to control tax and spending policies, this article presents such evidence. Regarding spending, we test whether the dispersion of spending authority among multiple committees creates a problem similar to that of the ""common pool."" Using American state data, we find that when only one committee has the authority to spend, spending is restrained relative to when spending authority is balkanized. Regarding spending, we hypothesize that if a single committee controls not only all spending authority but also all taxation authority, that committee will have more incentive to tax than a committee that does not control spending; it can obtain the benefits of increased taxation more directly.

"While representation in the U.S. House is based upon state population, each state has an equal number (two) of U.S. Senators. Thus, relative to the state delegations in the U.S. House, small population states are provided disproportionate bargaining power in the U.S. Senate. This paper provides new evidence on the role of this small state bargaining power in the distribution of federal funds using data on projects earmarked in appropriations bills between 1995 and 2003. Relative to earmarks secured in House appropriations bills, Senate earmarks exhibit a small state advantage that is both economically and statistically significant. The paper also examines two theoretically-motivated channels through which this small state advantage operates: increased proposal power through appropriations committee representation and the lower cost of securing votes due to smaller federal tax shares. Taken together, these two channels explain over 80 percent of the measured small state bias. Finally, a welfare analysis demonstrates the inefficiency of hte measured small state bias.","legislative representation, bargaining power and the distribution of federal funds: evidence from the us congress*",2004,The Economic Journal,Brian G.

To answer this question, we first develop a legislative bargaining model that describes negotiations over the allocation of distributive projects among legislators with different levels of seniority. Building on several predictions from the model, we develop two hypotheses for empirical testing. First, the adoption of term limits that results in a larger reduction in the variance of seniority within a legislature increases the amount of government spending. Second, legislatures that adopt stricter term limits increase the amount of government spending, while legislatures that adopt moderate term limits show no change in the amount.

"Reforming budgetary institutions for effective government is a critical task for emerging economies. Strengthening the role of parliament in the budget process is an integral part of the restoration of democracy throughout Latin America, which requires a re-equilibration of executive and legislative prerogatives in public policy.

"In order to evaluate a fiscal common-pool problem, this paper focuses on the relationship between local government council size and its expenditure. Generally, local councilors internalize the benefit of public projects targeted at their political jurisdictions, but underestimate and prefer to externalize the cost of public projects due to the national subsidy system. When council sizes become larger, their expenditure might be larger because of the selfish behavior of local council members. This paper estimates the positive effect of local council size on local government expenditure using a dataset of 13,989 municipalities in Japan over a period of 6 years. In Japan, local council size is a deterministic and discontinuous function of municipal population size under legal rules. We pay attention to this exogenous discontinuity and apply a regression discontinuity design to consider an endogeneity bias. The results show that the larger the size of the local council the larger the size of expenditure they undertake. In particular, we find that growing small municipalities tend to increase their expenditures, so that for example, 1% increases in local council size lead to about 1.2% increases of expenditures by small municipalities. Our results show that the fiscal common-pool problem is produced in small municipalities.",local government expenditure and council size: quasi-experimental evidence from japan,2012,Working Paper,"Haruaki Hirota, Hideo Yunoue",Microsoft Academic,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,997
"There is an extensive literature analyzing the executive branch within local U.S. government jurisdictions. This has largely revolved around the differences between elected mayors and appointed city managers. Much of the academic work has considered the potential efficiency gains that may be associated with either form of government and comparative analyses between the two. However, the empirical literature has been divided regarding the relative efficiency of either form. This paper attempts to add to that literature by considering how bond markets may perceive potential efficiencies that emerge from one executive type over the other by evaluating bond ratings for a sample of large municipal governments in the U.S. Overall, the results suggest that municipalities headed by a city manager are associated with increased bond ratings (and thus lower borrowing costs), which may lend support that this form of administration is, on some margin, relatively more efficient than others.

I argue that local government tools that help reduce income inequality may be underprovided due to the electoral risks faced by the local incumbents. The literature on clientelism and patronage together with the literature on the political budget cycle offers theoretical insights that explain why the opportunistic behavior of the incumbents depends on the development level of the polity. And while it is commonly assumed that specific types of expenditure are prone to manipulation, I challenge this view by showing how the socioeconomic characteristics of the locality influence the incumbents’ decision to strategically provide inequality-reducing policies.","local governments, democracy, and inequality: evidence on the political economy of inequality-reducing policies in local government in mexico",2015,State and Local Government Review,"Oliver D.

"Over the past three decades, efforts to increase minority incorporation and representation have resulted in a shift away from at-large toward district-based elections in American cities. Observers and academics have blamed this institutional change for encouraging elected official to focus on district priorities while ignoring --- and perhaps even sacrificing --- broader municipal needs. Have improved electoral prospects for minority candidates come at the cost of parochialism and logrolling on city councils, as traditional models of urban and distributive politics predict? Using seven years worth of roll call data from the Los Angeles city council, we examine the hypothesis that district elections lead to vote-trading among its members. Overall, our analysis finds little evidence for distributive theories of legislative voting. Instead, the results support a model of conditional deference, suggesting that a district-based electoral system does not always incentivize elected officials to ignore the larger concerns of their polity when creating policy.",local logrolling? examining the impact of district representation on distributive politics,2012,NA,"Vladimir Kogan1, Craig M.

The median voter (in income) in each jurisdiction determines the probability of re-election for the incumbent government. The jurisdiction with the median of these median voters is most favoured. With identical median voters in jurisdictions, and with re-election requiring less than 50mandate, jurisdictions with higher income inequality get favoured. Results from a survey data (from NCAER) on infrastructure provision in 1669 Indian villages confirm this hypothesis.

"We analyze whether voters value local political representation by exploiting municipal mergers, which increase the number of candidates available to voters and intensify political competition. In the Finnish open-list proportional representation system, voters rank the candidates within parties, and thus, concentrating votes to local candidates increases the extent of local representation. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the vote distributions become more concentrated in municipalities less likely to gain local representation after the mergers. Moreover, the effect is much larger in municipalities where the benefits of local representation to voters are large. The latter result disentangles voters' responses from the responses of other political actors. The results are important also for designing local government mergers, which are an important policy tool in many countries. They highlight that concerns over deteriorating local democracy due to mergers have merit, because voters have preferences for local representation. At the same time, the vote concentration patterns we find alleviate these concerns.",local representation and strategic voting: evidence from electoral boundary reforms.,2016,European Journal of Political Economy,"Tuukka Saarimaa1, Janne Tukiainen1VATT Institute for Economic Research, P.O.

"As a growing research program has illustrated, parl iaments are not merely ‘rubber stamps’ for governmental proposals. Analyzing the voting stage on government legislation can thus be extremely informative in parliamentary settings: are governme nt bills backed just by the representatives forming the legislative majority, or do they (also) receive the votes of members of the opposition? The present paper examines the degree of support th at governmental legislation enjoys at the final vot e in Italy. In this regard, the Italian case seems pa rticularly interesting: despite the harsh confronta tion among parties in the public debate, legislation (in cluding government bills) has usually been approved by very large parliamentary majorities, and the con sensuality characterizing Italian lawmaking seems t o have survived even the end of the pivotal First Rep ublic and the shift to the alternational and (would -be) majoritarian Second Republic. Up to now, the literature has primarily focused on the aggregate figures of the degree of support gain ed by Italian laws at the final voting stage in the pa rliament, while the internal differences between mo re and less consensual processes remain a rather under studied topic. However, not all the bills introduce d by the Italian governments are approved in a consen sual manner. Their approval can be more universal in some cases, and more strictly majoritarian in ot her cases. This work investigates such a variance. In particul ar, a set of explanatory hypotheses are empirically evaluated against data on the legislative productio n of Italian governments over a relatively long per iod of time (1988-2006). The hypotheses I test include the policy divisions between majority and oppositio n, the complexity of the bargaining environment, distr ibutive logics and legislative impatience. Remarkably, I also evaluate the impact of two facto rs that are specifically related to the processes through which bills are approved: the length of the legislative process and the extent to which bills are modified in parliament before approval. Taking into account these two important process-related aspect s may contribute to a more dynamic study of what happens at the final voting stage in the parliament.",looking beyond the aggregate figures. an investigation of the consensual approval of italian government bills (1988-2006).,2012,NA,Andrea Pedrazzani1University of Bologna,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"▪ Abstract Research on comparative decentralization and federalism is a booming industry. Recent research integrates insights from political science, economics, and economic history in emphasizing the importance of incentives for the operation of decentralized government. Such work has focused particular attention on fiscal, representative, and party institutions. In reviewing the past decade's research, I make two arguments. First, the comparative research on decentralization and federalism provides a model for how comparative politics can address some of the most profound questions in social thought by focusing on a theoretically and empirically tractable aspect of governance. Second, although the research addresses many of the key questions in comparative politics, it also struggles with some of the same problems and challenges as comparative politics writ large, particularly the issue of institutional endogeneity.

"Inherent in majority rule institutions is the incentive to particularize benefits and to collectivize costs, and this majoritarian incentive can lead to the adoption of economically inefficient distributive programs. These inefficient, or pork barrel, programs are often said to occur under a norm of universalism in which benefits are distributed among all legislative districts. The distribution of particularistic benefits is studied in the context of a legislative model that reflects the sequential nature of proposal making and voting. The set of distributive programs that a legislature will adopt in a perfect Nash equilibrium is characterized, and although inefficient programs will be adopted, the distribution of benefits is majoritarian and not universalistic. The set of programs that will be adopted depends on the amendment procedure used by the legislature, and the set corresponding to a closed rule that prohibits amendments includes very inefficient programs. Through the use of procedures, however, the legislature is able to control the extent of the inefficiency. For example, allowing amendments under an open rule limits, but does not eliminate, the inefficiency of the programs that would be adopted by the legislature. From an ex ante perspective, the legislature prefers an open rule to a closed rule for those policy jurisdictions in which inefficient programs can be expected to be proposed.","majoritarian incentives, pork barrel programs, and procedural control",1991,American Journal of Political Science,David P.

"In the Malaysian federal system, the central government is in a dominant position and thestates depend heavily on fiscal transfers from the centre to meet their budgetary needs.This model of fiscal federalism is widely regarded to have a negative impact on states‘ fiscalperformance, in turn, affecting the overall performance of the economy. Havingexperienced three decades of rapid growth, Malaysian economic growth has been sluggishsince the Asian financial crisis of 1997, and there is a widely shared view that the countryneeds a radical change in its economic development strategy in order to break out of themiddle income trap. The National Economic Action Council of Malaysia has also beencritical of the previous growth model for being inadequate for meeting this challenge, andthe government‘s New Economic Model (NEM) aims at developing a system of governancethat empowers the private sector for broad-based inclusive development.In this context, the aim of this thesis is to explore whether new insights gained from thelatest model of federalism – the Market Preserving Federalism (MPF) – can be applied inMalaysia for reforming intergovernmental fiscal relations and for improving both nationaland regional economic growth potential. The concept of market preserving federalism(MPF) proposes a form of fiscal federalism with decentralised governance that functions onmarket-based principles, hard budget constraints, and fiscal accountability. The thesisinvestigates how the current model of fiscal decentralisation in Malaysia can be improved tosupport a market-based economy. Using econometric analysis of public finance data fortwo decades (1990-2009), the thesis evaluates the four critical attributes of Malaysianfederalism, namely fiscal decentralisation, subnational competition, efficiency of publicfinances, and equity of outcomes by analysing the relationships between fiscaldecentralisation and governmental incentives for revenue raising, public expenditure, anddebt financing. In particular, the thesis analyses the nature of incentive structuresgenerated by the current soft budget constraints faced by subnational governments andtheir effects on regional and national economic performance.

"Publisher SummaryThis chapter focuses on the micro-economic reasons for market failure and the micro-political analysis of government performance. Governments provide goods and services directly, redistribute income, and regulate economic relations. The chapter reviews recent recommendations for the institutional reform of the budgetary process. The new political economy is concerned with the most basic question of economic policy: It discusses the circumstances where markets or governments are preferred as the institution for allocating societal resources. The new political economy is the sophistication of analytic technique. The voting process can protect against dictatorship but generally at the cost of social efficiency. In Western societies, the decision has been made to protect democracy; the task then is to search for the most efficient collective choice process consistent with this norm. The results of this examination emerge in the new quantitative political economy and the empirical examination of government spending, taxation, and regulation.","markets, governments, and the ""new"" political economy",1987,Handbook of Public Economics,Robert P.

"Although recent research has shed new light on the political determinants and economic consequences of tax lawmaking, existing analyses rely on coarse data measuring political aggregates. Consequently, little is known about the political processes determining how tax legislation is written or their effect on the nature of tax reforms. This paper therefore develops a methodology to examine how Congress edits the content of tax legislation by measuring the ways Deputies, Senators, Presidents, and Ministers propose and amend such legislation. The Legislative Substance Scale proposed here measures the distance between a bill’s original position and the actual outcome of the legislative process by comparing the differences in content according to coding of the main tax policy dimensions. The scale is used to build the first systematic database of tax lawmaking in Argentina, and to describe its general patterns of authorship, approval and substantive content across presidencies in the current democratic period.",measuring the political economy of tax lawmaking: a methodology and evidence from argentina,2013,NA,"Javier Alvaredo, Alejandro Bonvecchi1, Ernesto F.

"International lenders of last resorts are often accused to create financial instability because they generate moral hazard. The evidence for this is thin and plagued with measurement error. Examining the case of the US, we use the number of American troops hosted by third countries to measure how strongly the US is committed to them. We find that increasing the number of US troops by one standard deviation above the mean raises the probability of a financial crisis in the host country by about 12 to 14 percentage points. We also investigate the channels through which moral hazard materializes. Countries with more US troops conduct more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, implement riskier financial regulations, and receive more capital, especially from US banks.

"Scholars of American politics typically conceptualize representation as mass-elite policy congruence, and in doing so have found several factors that hinder that relationship. These findings are at odds with the fact that American legislators often gain enough support to win re-election. I present an explanation for this puzzle by showing that legislators strategically provide four unique dimensions of representation to their constituents: policy, service, allocation, and descriptive. I unify these dimensions in a single theoretical model of legislators’ priorities, then test it with data from survey experiments administered to 1,175 state legislators. I posit that legislators systematically emphasize some dimensions over others to further the goal of reelection. Given the constraints of resources and costs, legislators must choose their representational focus based on perceived electoral benefits. I find that institutional, district, and individual-level traits alter these resources, costs, and benefits, thereby driving legislators’ strategic representational behavior.",multidimensional responsiveness: the determinants of legislators' representational priorities,2013,Legislative Studies Quarterly,Jeffrey J.

"One of the fundamental questions in democratic governance is whether policies are best decided by elected officials or by appointed bureaucrat-experts. The study examines this issue in the context of how municipal government form influences government-wide budgetary solvency. Government form creates distinct incentives for executive action that shape budget outcomes. In mayor–council governments, the elected executive’s desire to be reelected increases responsiveness to voters’ preferences. Vote maximization incentivizes the adoption of policies that are popular among voters but can lead to budgetary imbalance. In contrast, the appointed executive in the council–manager form is interested in career advancement, which she achieves by building a reputation for leading a fiscally sound government. Insulated from the demands of voters, the manager can rely on expert knowledge and professional norms to choose policies that result in balanced budgets. Using data from audited financial reports for 655 mid-sized and large city governments in the United States from fiscal years 2006 to 2013, the econometric analysis shows that council–manager cities have stronger budgetary solvency compared with mayor–council cities.","municipal government form and budget outcomes: political responsiveness, bureaucratic insulation, and the budgetary solvency of cities",2019,Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory,Benedict S Jimenez1Georgia State University,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1016

"By providing a long run reconstruction of regional Net Fiscal Flows (NFFs) in Italy throughout the last six decades (1951-2010), this paper documents the substantial rise of fiscal transfers to Mezzogiorno (i.e. Southern Italy) from the rest of the country. Besides, three further arguments are presented. First, we find that the prominent upsurge of NFFs in 1980s and 1990s has exerted a scarce impact on the North-South gap, mainly because it has not been connected to a stronger commitment in supply-side regional and development policies, and the needed rise of capital expenditure in Mezzogiorno. Second, we ascribe most of the increase in NFFs to the generalized escalation in current primary expenditure related to the “decentralization without accountability” design of fiscal reforms implemented in the 1970s. Third, we evaluate the size of interregional redistribution in the light of regional income differences and the burden imposed to contributing regions. By making use of several indexes and analytical procedures intensively used in the literature, we reach the conclusion that interregional redistribution in Italy has been moderate, considering the severity of initial differences in economic and social conditions.",net fiscal flows and interregional redistribution in italy: a long-run perspective (1951–2010),2016,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,"Adriano Giannola1, Carmelo Petraglia2, Domenico Scalera31SVIMEZ, Association for the Industrial Development of Southern Italy, 2University of Basilicata, 3University of Sannio",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article applies cost-benefit analysis to the Canadian Pacific commercial salmon fishery. It demonstrates that government policies to preserve the fishery have resulted in higher net social costs than would have resulted from a ""do nothing"" policy, notwithstanding the rent dissipation associated with unconstrained resource exploitation. The value of landings and the private costs of the harvest over a cycle (1988-1994) are calculated. On average, fishers extracted rents of C$34.7 million (in constant 1995 Canadian dollars) annually. The public costs of enhancing the resource and organizing and policing the harvest are estimated. When these costs are included in the calculation, net benefits drop to an average of negative C$55.6 million annually. This translates into a net present value (NPV) of the salmon fishery of negative C$784. The effects on NPV of both modest policy changes implemented in 1996-1997 and of a more dramatic but credible fleet rationalization program are provided. The results indicate that further policy change is called for. More generally, the study shows that policy reform that would significantly benefit both the private sector (through reduced rent dissipation) and the public sector (through reduced government expenditures) can be surprisingly difficult. © 2000 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",net loss: a cost‐benefit analysis of the canadian pacific salmon fishery,2000,Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,"Richard Schwindt1, Aidan Vining1, Steven Globerman21Simon Fraser University, 2Western Washington University",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The Voting Right Act guaranteed the right to vote for minorities, including the prohibition of any electoral discriminatory practices on the basis of race. This triggered a series of court decisions outlawing discriminatory electoral rules between 1970 and 1990. I study the effects of several court orders that guarantee minority representation on city public budgets, and find that both local public good expenditures (5-7.5%) and city tax collection (5-10%) increased, after the changes towards non-discriminatory electoral rules. I also explore the distributional consequences of non-discriminatory elections and find that the fraction of black public workers and citizens increased after changes in the election system, while those of whites decreased. The growth rates of black house values and rents also increase more. The findings are inconsistent with a negative effect of ethnic heterogeneity in the city council on public goods, and with common-pool theories.

"Previous theoretical and empirical research has shown that policymakers have an incentive to centralize government activities in order to weaken the competitive pressure of fiscal federalism. We propose and test a positive model of fiscal federalism in which centralization is less likely to occur where budget referendums are possible.

We also assess the determinants of transfers from the central government to the regions.

"This paper argues that the nationalization of electoral alignments and party organization has repercussions for the extent to which 'regional favouritism' is a dominant feature of distributive policy in a particular country. In particular, coalitional politics in the presence of parties with narrow geographic bases of support, such as regional parties or parties with regionalized patterns of support, may encourage 'over-investment' by central governments in distributive log-rolling and regional pork-barrel spending. Empirically, the paper explores patterns in the regional allocation of infrastructure investment to Provinces by central government in Spain from 1978-2010, and tests two central hypotheses. Firstly, it investigates the extent to which regional parties in Spain have historically been able to secure disproportional investment for core support constituencies, when these parties are pivotal for government formation. Secondly, we explore a more novel hypothesis relating the relative nationalization of the major governing parties of the democratic era, to their propensity to engage in political distribution towards favoured electoral constituencies. The paper finds that parties vary significantly in their use of tactical 'pork-barrel' spending, depending on the degree to which their electoral support is 'nationalized' across all regions within the country.",party nationalization and the politics of geographic redistribution in spain,2014,NA,"Mark Canavan1Trinity College, Dublin",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Our main findings highlight that individual preferences driven by distributive interests are more likely to be accommodated in the case of legislators who are close to their party in ideological terms. On the contrary, ideological proximity to the party does not seem to affect committee assignment when MPs’ preferences are driven by expertise-based motivations.","personal ambitions, expertise and parties’ control : understanding committee assignment in the italian chamber of deputies",2019,Parliamentary Affairs,"Daniela Giannetti1, Andrea Pedrazzani1, Luca Pinto21University of Bologna, 2Institute of Human and Social Studies, Scuola Normale Superiore, Firenze, Italy",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper discusses the common-pool problems that arise when multiple territorially overlapping governments share the authority to provide services and levy taxes in a common geographic area.

I test the model empirically using data from U.S. counties and find a strong positive relationship between the number of overlapping jurisdictions and the size of the local public sector.

"We evaluate the effect of relaxing fiscal rules on policy outcomes applying a quasi-experimental research design. In 1999, the Italian central government introduced fiscal rules aimed at imposing fiscal discipline on municipal governments, and in 2001 the rules were relaxed for municipalities below 5,000 inhabitants. This institutional change allows us to implement a ""difference-in-discontinuities"" design by combining the before/after with the discontinuous policy variation. Our estimates show that relaxing fiscal rules triggers a substantial deficit bias, captured by a shift from a balanced budget to a deficit that amounts to 2 percent of the total budget. The deficit comes primarily from reduced revenues as unconstrained municipalities have lower real estate and income tax rates. Finally, we investigate the heterogeneity in policy responses across municipalities to provide new evidence about the costs and benefits of restricting fiscal policy. The impact is larger if the mayor can run for reelection, the number of political parties seated in the city council is higher, voters are older, the performance of the mayor in providing public good is lower, and cities are characterized by historical deficit, consistently with models on the political economy of fiscal adjustment.",policy responses to fiscal restraints: a difference-in-discontinuities design,2012,NA,"Veronica Grembi1, Tommaso Nannicini, Ugo Troiano21IZA Institute of Labor Economics, 2Harvard University",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Does policymakers\' horizon affect their willingness to support economic reforms? Voting in the U.S. Congress provides an ideal setting to address this question. Differences between the House and Senate, in which members serve two-year and six-year mandates respectively, allow to examine the role of term length; the staggered structure of the Senate allows to compare the behavior of different \""generations\"" of senators and study the impact of election proximity. Considering all major trade liberalization reforms undertaken by the U.S. since the early 1970\'s, we find that Senate members are more likely to support them than House members. However, inter-cameral differences disappear for third-generation senators, who face re-election at the same time as House members. Considering Senate votes alone, we find that the last generation is more protectionist than the previous two and this result holds both when comparing different senators voting on the same bill, as well as individual senators voting on different bills. Inter-generational differences disappear instead for senators who hold safe seats or have announced their retirement, indicating that the protectionist effect of election proximity is driven by legislators\' fear of losing office.",policymakers’ horizon and trade reforms,2011,NA,"Paola Conconi1, Giovanni Facchini2, 3, Maurizio Zanardi11Université libre de Bruxelles, 2University of Milan, 3Erasmus University Rotterdam",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper argues that legislative incentives to overspend are not confined to local public good provision, but also plague non-targetable (global) public good provision, such as public safety and public health. The channel for the second type of spending is different from the common pool logic, however. To identify this channel I model fragmentation of fiscal power in a political agency setup with legislative bargaining. First, legislators lack common pool incentives when benefits cannot be targeted. Second, fragmentation of agenda power in the legislature weakens voters' control over agenda setters by reducing the value of their office -- weak external accountability. This allows the government to initiate public projects with high unwarranted costs. Third, a check on their behavior is a larger number of legislators, creating internal accountability. I estimate the effects of fragmentation on budget performance by exploiting a state-mandated reorganization of Kentucky county governments at the end of the 1970s that substantially enhanced the power of the office of county executive. I present difference-in-differences estimates using a 1962-1997 panel that contains counties in the neighboring state of West Virginia as the control group. The results indicate that the centralization of executive power has led to significant reductions in several categories of county revenues as well as spending and in improvements in both budget balance and indebtedness position.",political accountability for public spending,2008,NA,Razvan Vlaicu1Inter-American Development Bank,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1041

"This paper analyzes the link between fiscal balance and political competition. Two conflicting hypotheses are formulated and tested in the literature, with no consensus as to which is correct. The first hypothesis states that political competition increases the accountability of politicians and thus increasing the efficiency of the public sector. The second states the opposite, suggesting that political competition leads to inefficiencies which are the result of the necessity to form a coalition. I test these hypotheses with budgetary and political data on municipalities in Israel for the years 1997-2006. The results suggest that the aforementioned hypotheses could both hold true, depending on the level of the competition. Low levels of political competition are associated with large debts. However, high levels of political competition are also associated with large debts, while the smallest levels of debt arise when political competition is intermediate. Low levels of political competition might be caused by the tendency of Arab residents to vote according to their clan affiliation. I also find evidence of political budget cycles in Israeli municipalities, where election years result in greater deficits. These cycles might be another mechanism by which the effect of political competition takes place, as they are also affected by the level of political competition.",political competition and fiscal status: evidence from municipalities in israel,2015,Local Government Studies,Yaniv Reingewertz1University of Haifa,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1043

"Observed fiscal policy varies greatly across time and countries. How can we explain this variation across time and countries? This paper surveys the recent literature that has tried to answer this question. We adopt a unified approach in portraying public policy as the equilibrium outcome of an explicitly specified political process. We divide the material into three parts. In Part I, we focus on median-voter equilibria that apply to policy issues where disagreement between voters is likely to be one-dimensional. We thus study the general redistributive programs which are typical of the modern welfare state: redistribution between rich and poor, young and old, employed and unemployed, resident of different regions, and labor and capital. In Part II we study special interest politics. Here the policy problem is multi-dimensional and we focus on specific political mechanisms: we study legislative bargaining, lobbying, and electoral competition, as well as the possible interactions between these different forms of political activity. Finally, Part III deals with a set of questions that can be brought under the label of comparative politics. Here we deal with policy choice under alternative political constitutions; we model the rationale for separation of powers and contrast the stylized features of congressional and parliamentary political systems, focusing on their implications for rent extraction by politicians, redistribution and public goods provision.",political economics and public finance,1999,National Bureau of Economic ResearchSocial Science Research Network,"Torsten Persson1, Guido Tabellini21Stockholm University, 2Bocconi University",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1045
"We develop a dynamic recursive model where political and economic decisions interact, to study how excessive debt-GDP ratios affect political sustainability of prudent fiscal policies. Rent seeking groups make political decisions – to cooperate (or not) – on the allocation of fiscal budgets (including rents) and issuance of sovereign debt. A classic commons problem triggers collective fiscal impatience and excessive debt issuing, leading to a vicious circle of high borrowing costs and sovereign default. We analytically characterize debt-GDP thresholds that foster cooperation among rent seeking groups and avoid default. Our analysis and application helps in understanding the politico-economic sustainability of sovereign rescues, emphasizing the need for fiscal targets and possible debt haircuts.

"The literature has come to no agreement about the empirical validity of the so-called weak government hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, political fragmentation should lead to higher government expenditure. With the aim of reconciling the empirical evidence with theory, in this paper we discuss and test a new hypothesis about this relationship: that fragmentation should matter for public spending only to the extent that the degree of polarization is high enough. Our results for a sample of presidential democracies show that a marginal change in the level of fragmentation in the governing coalition affects positively the size of the budget, but only if there is some degree of polarization. We also find that what matters for fiscal policy in presidential democracies is the degree of fragmentation and polarization within the governing coalition, rather than in the legislature at large. For parliamentary democracies we find erratic patterns for the relationship between fragmentation and public spending.

This paper tests whether Rodrik's (1999) results that institutions for conflict management are associated with the ability to react to economic shocks are robust to different ways of defining the quality of such institutions. We measure the quality of conflict management institutions with two different indices. The first is an index of political constraints on the ability of the executive to impose its will. These constraints limit the ability of the government to arbitrarily change the rules of the game and therefore may reduce redistributive struggles. The second index measures the degree of political particularism. We define political particularism as the policymakers' ability to further their career by catering to narrow interests rather than broader national platforms. The indices used in this paper solve the endogeneity and subjectivity biases that affect Rodrik's measure of institutional quality. We find strong support for the idea that high levels of political constraints and intermediate levels of political particularism are associated with a quick recovery from economic shocks.,political institutions and growth collapses,2000,NA,"Ugo Panizza1, Alejandro Gaviria2, Ernesto H.

However, the effect is more complicated across the different types and performers of research than expected.

This literature concludes, inter alia, that tax-and-transfer-system (T&T) sizes increase in the skew of the income distribution. This paper builds from that basis, suggesting theoretical additions and amendments deriving from further consideration of the democratic processes that transform resources into influence. It especially emphasizes that not everyone participates politically and that who participates is non-randomly selected. This implies that aggregate participation rates will mediate T&T responses to income inequality, and, conversely, that income inequality will mediate T&T responses to aggregate participation rates. Specifically, since the relatively wealthy have higher propensity to participate politically, higher aggregate participation rates will generally coincide with increased democratic representation of the relatively less well-off, suggesting that democratic governments will respond to greater inequality with larger T&T increases the higher the participation rate and, vice versa, higher participation induces larger T&T responses the more skewed the underlying income distribution. Regression analysis of the postwar T&T experiences of developed democracies support that hypothesis empirically.","political participation, income distribution, and public transfers in developed democracies",2001,NA,Robert J.

"This paper utilizes principal-agency theory to examine the function of political parties as an intermediary between voters and legislators. Use of this theory in a set of essays stimulated by the contributions of Douglass C. North and Oliver E. Williamson seems highly appropriate. Transactions costs, information transmission, monitoring problems, and other elements of principal-agency theory often provide the foundation for the work of both North and Williamson. This paper examines the role that political parties play in the principal-agent relationship that exists between voters and their elected representatives. We argue that political parties, seeking to protect their brand-name capital, 1 will monitor legislators and discourage opportunistic behavior by their members. An erosion of party influence, such as has occurred in the United States, weakens the party's ability to monitor the principal-agent relationship between voters and legislators. This causes an increase in special interest legislation and opportunistic behavior by legislators.",political parties and the legislative principal-agent relationship,2016,NA,"Randall G.

"This paper uses a panel of 22 OECD Development Assistance Committee countries to examine whether fragmentation of executive power and the degree of competition from the legislative branch of government increased the amount of tied aid over the period 1979--2009. Fragmentation is defined as the degree to which the costs of a dollar of aid expenditure are internalized by decision-makers and is measured as the number of decision-makers in government. Legislative competition is defined as the relative strength of the government in relation to the legislature. Three variables are used to capture this effect. The empirical results show tied aid, both in levels and as a percentage of total aid, increases as the number of decision-makers within the government increases, and decreases as the proportion of excess seats a governing coalition holds above a simple majority increases.",political power and aid tying practices in the development assistance committee countries,2013,Oxford Development Studies,Jared A.

"This paper provides a rational explanation for the observation of oversized coalitions, often approaching unanimous size, in the realm of distributive policies. Distributive policies are those which concentrate benefits in specific geographic areas (states, congressional districts) while spreading costs through general taxation. The explanation offered here-that legislators may rationally prefer universalism to ""hard-ball"" coalition politics-generalizes earlier work of Weingast and Fiorina. In particular, it extends their results to pork-barrel politics, i.e., projects that are economically inefficient, and demonstrates how packages of economically inefficient projects can nevertheless be politically popular. The main theoretical feature that induces preferences for universalism is uncertainty over the composition of winning coalitions and, consequently, the desire for the political ""insurance"" that universalism provides.",political preferences for the pork barrel: a generalization,1981,American Journal of Political Science,"Kenneth A.

"This paper explores the role of political stability on fiscal policy in a time-series analysis over 158 years at the Swiss federal level. We argue that the fiscal commons problem of public finances is affected by the number of years a finance minister remains in office, because the incentives for an incumbent to maintain a good reputation with sound policy decisions are stronger. A finance minister who succeeds to stay a long time in office enjoys a politically powerful position towards the administration, parliament and interest groups. In contrast, frequent government turnover weakens the position of the finance minister.",political stability and fiscal policy: time series evidence for the swiss federal level since 1849,2010,Public Choice,"Lars P.

"The institutions that define the sequence of delegations that democracy entails have systematic effects on public policy. Democratic states that systematically provide public goods are typically seen as having three characteristics: they are decisive; they have the administrative capacity to implement whatever decisions they make; and they are only responsive to broad public interests. We investigate the two primary ways in which democratic states are said to fail in this regard: through an inability to decide or to pursue a consistent policy; and through the excessive influence of interest groups, which reduces public policy to an allocation of pork and a chase after rents. The first is a problem of state indecisiveness, the latter a defect in the nature of accountability, with too much responsiveness to special interests and too little responsiveness to general interests. More specifically, we argue that political actors' incentives are significantly influenced by the rules regulating electoral competition, while their capabilities are determined jointly by their electoral success and the constitutionally stipulated powers of the various governmental posts that are at stake (either directly or indirectly) in elections. Different combinations of capabilities and incentives--Are governmental powers separated, with different actors controlling different institutional veto points? Are governmental powers unified in a single post or body, with a single actor controlling that post or body?--systematically affect the degree to which the state can act decisively and the degree to which it is responsive to broad public as opposed to narrow special interests.",political structure and economic policy: the institutional determinants of policy outcomes,2007,NA,"Gary W.

"Politics, the grouping together of people for power in any structural entity is not discussed much in the field of project management. Beyond satisfying the iron triangle expectations, critical issues of politics and power affect effective project execution. Project managers and other internal stakeholders jostle for control of resources, and their power base is politics. Effective project management cannot ignore the politics of organizations, as it is these political factors that determine the success or failure of a project. Depending on the size and the interest on the project by senior management, political influence threads through the whole organisational structure, too often it is accepted as the norm. The survey sought to establish the extent to which political forces are used by senior management and can be used by the project manager in project execution to pre-empt the effects of the authority gap in project management. This paper establishes that there is tremendous interference during project executions to varying degrees as a result of political interests, the management styles of senior management, organisational structure and factors, and the extent of personal stakeholder interests in the project. The target population for the empirical research was operational and management staff of two large government construction projects, which employ approximately 800 people per site, including 46 subcontractors and their staff. Questionnaires were administered through personal interviews giving a 100% questionnaire return rate. The results point to constant political interference from external and internal stakeholders.",politics and project execution : how organisational politics impact the effectiveness of project managers: the government’s dilemma,2014,NA,Larry E Jowah1Cape Peninsula University of Technology,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

" Many governmental policies require
 choosing among projects that have different
 costs and that will last for different lengths
 of time. Much of the theoretical literature on
 such choices asks what discount rate govern-
 ment should use in evaluating projects. Thus,
 Kenneth Arrow and Robert Lind (1970) ar-
 gue that because government spreads a large
 number of risks among numerous citizens, it
 should properly choose a low risk premium,
 which is reflected in a low discount rate.
 Others argue that low discount rates reflect
 the influence of special interests, that con-
 gressmen view construction costs as bene-
 fits to some of their constituents (Barry
 Weingast, Kenneth Shepsle, and Christopher
 Johnsen, 1981), and that people behave dif-
 ferently when making social decisions than
 when making private ones (Howard Margo-
 lis, 1982). I argue here, instead, that rational
 voters will show a consistent bias in favor of
 building durable projects that they would
 oppose were the decision theirs alone to
 make; this bias, moreover, has nothing to do
 with risk aversion, altruism, income redistri-
 bution, or the influence of special interests",politics and the choice of durability,1989,The American Economic Review,Amihai Glazer,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper examines the link between legislative politics, hospital behavior, and health care spending. When trying to pass sweeping legislation, congressional leaders can attract votes by adding targeted provisions that steer money toward the districts of reluctant legislators. This targeted spending provides tangible local benefits that legislators can highlight when fundraising or running for reelection. We study a provision - Section 508 – that was added to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA). Section 508 created a pathway for hospitals to apply to get their Medicare payment rates increased. We find that hospitals represented by members of the House of Representatives who voted ‘Yea’ on the MMA were significantly more likely to receive a 508 waiver than hospitals represented by members who voted ‘Nay.’ Following the payment increase generated by the 508 program, recipient hospitals treated more patients, increased payroll, hired nurses, added new technology, raised CEO pay, and ultimately increased their spending by over $100 million annually. Section 508 recipient hospitals formed the Section 508 Hospital Coalition, which spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to extend the program. After the vote on the MMA and before the vote to reauthorize the 508 program, members of Congress with a 508 hospital in their district received a 22% increase in total campaign contributions and a 65% increase in contributions from individuals working in the health care industry in the members’ home states. Our work demonstrates a pathway through which the link between politics and Medicare policy can dramatically affect US health spending.","politics, hospital behavior, and health care spending",2017,NA,"Zack Cooper, Amanda E.

"This paper analyzes the political determinants of the distribution of infrastructure expenditures by the Italian government to the country’s 92 provinces between 1953 and 1994. Extending implications of theories of legislative behavior to the context of open-list proportional representation, we examine whether individually powerful legislators and ruling parties direct spending to core or marginal electoral districts, and whether opposition parties share resources via a norm of universalism. We show that when districts elect politically more powerful deputies from the governing parties, they receive more investments. We interpret this as indicating that legislators with political resources reward their core voters by investing in public works in their districts. The governing parties, by contrast, are not able to discipline their own members of parliament sufficiently to target the parties’ areas of core electoral strength. Finally, we find no evidence that a norm of universalism operates to steer resources to areas when the main opposition party gains more votes.","pork barrel politics in postwar italy, 1953-1994",2008,American Journal of Political Science,"Miriam A.

"Pork-barrel effects are discussed using a specific program of Portuguese investment expenditures (PIDDAC) that has been observed since 1997. My framework adds new insight to this important branch of economics literature. First, my analysis is the first to be based on sequential dictators games, which are more appropriate for studying the strategies of the agents involved in pork-barrel practices. Second, I examine the role of ‘irrelevance effects’, which limit or offset the pork-barrel effect even if the recipient muni­cipality and the Portuguese government are ruled by the same political wing. My empirical estimations confirm that the Portuguese government tends to increase PIDDAC transfers to the municipalities that are being ruled by the same political wing. Municipalities with fewer residents or fewer parishes tend to suffer the most significant irrelevance effects. PIDDAC transfers to all municipalities were found to be more generous during election years.

"Most agency-based privatization models are of the owner/manager relation and ignore the labor market. Yet in the 1980s there were profound changes in public sector and privatized firms to wages and employment. The authors develop a bargaining model of the manager/workforce relation that explains employment and wages when firms are privatized, government objectives become more commercial, and markets are liberalized. Using data on fourteen U.K. companies, 1972-88, that were publicly owned in 1972, the authors find: (1) employment fell following the change to more commercial objectives; and (2) wages were only slightly affected by this, but fell if the firm lost market power.

"New indices of fiscal rule strength are constructed and, using a dynamic panel econometric model for 27 EU countries over the period 1990–2012, we assess whether national fiscal rules alone help to promote sustainable public finances in the EU or whether they must be supported by good governance in order to be effective. We find that fiscal rules are effective in reducing structural primary deficits at all levels of government efficiency. However, the effect is smaller as government efficiency increases, indicating that fiscal rules and government efficiency are institutional substitutes in terms of promoting fiscal sustainability. We also find that balanced budget rules are the most effective form of fiscal rules. Multiple fiscal rules are found to enhance fiscal solvency. Other institutional features that enhance the effectiveness of fiscal rules are transparency of policies and commitment to implementation of fiscal programs. Supranational rules, however, do not affect the effectiveness of national fiscal rules in reducing the deficit bias.

"The origins of public finance, as a field of study though most certainly not as an object of practice, can be traced to the emergence of the cameralists after 1500 in central Europe (Backhaus and Wagner, 1987). The focal point of cameralist concern was on survival of the regime, which in turn, required a military capacity and economic development. This concern about development took place within absolutist regimes that existed in a highly competitive, Tiebout-style (1956) environment. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648, for instance, recognized more than 300 independent units of governance within the cameralist lands. Joseph Schumpeter (1954: 143–208) described the cameralists well when he referred to them as “Consultant Administrators.” They were both consultants and administrators. They were consultants to the various kings, princes, and other royal personages who ruled throughout those lands. The cameralists were not, however, anything like contemporary academic consultants. They were real-world administrators as well. They were engaged in such activities as managing mines or glass works. Many of the cameralists also held academic posts (as noted in Albion Small’s (1909) thorough but more descriptive than analytical examination).",public finance in democratic process,2004,NA,Richard E.

Using a political economy approach, we consider the likely differences in internal and collaborative R&D activities under regulatory and market regimes, and test the predictions on R&D investments by a panel of investor owned electric utilities between 1989 and 1997. We find that spending on internal projects declines with the uncertainty associated with restructuring, but recuperates for companies in states that transition to relative competitive market regimes. Alternatively, external R&D expenditures (outsourced or consortium activities) are initially higher for firms subject to the uncertainty of the policy transition but subsequently decline in restructuring states. Our analysis yields insights into the incentives for firms to perform research internally or to outsource it, and suggests some new guidelines for effective public technology programs.",r&d choice in restructured industries: in-house v/s collaborative research in the us electricity industry,2004,NA,"Linda R.

However, they have tended to do so in ways that assume the absence of sufficient information or rationality on the part of actors.

"In recent years some of the best theoretical work on the political economy of political institutions and processes has begun surfacing outside the political science mainstream in high quality economics journals. This two-part paper surveys these contributions from a recent five-year period. In Part I, the focus is on elections, voting and information aggregation, followed by treatments of parties, candidates, and coalitions. In Part II, papers on economic performance and redistribution, constitutional design, and incentives, institutions, and the quality of political elites are discussed. Part II concludes with a discussion of the methodological bases common to economics and political science, the way economists have used political science research, and some new themes and arbitrage opportunities. This is the second part of a two-part survey of articles germane to political science found in the leading economics journals in recent years. We undertook this task because it had become apparent in recent years that a considerable body of formal political economy began appearing in the top economics journals. In the five-year period from the point we commenced this project (2000-2004), we found more than one hundred articles in the five leading journals. 1 From this universe we survey approximately sixty, with references to many others as well. In Part I, the focus was on elections, voting and information aggregation, followed by a treatment of parties, candidates, and coalitions. In this part we examine papers on redistribution, constitutional design, and the incentives and quality of political elites. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological and theoretical foundations of political economy shared by economist and political scientist alike, the resources each political economy type draws from the other’s literature, and some available intellectual arbitrage opportunities.","recent economic perspectives on political economy, part ii",2008,British Journal of Political Science,"Torun Dewan1, Kenneth A.

"In South Korea, it has been widely known that an incumbent president allocates a disproportionally larger amount of intergovernmental transfers to regions with more loyal supporters. It has been also believed that despite a government change in 1997, this positive and linear relationship between support for an incumbent president and allocated public funds did not change. We show that neither is valid. Based on a formal model, we argue that an incumbent president allocates a larger amount not only in his own turf but also in his rival’s and a smaller amount in regions where votes are divided more evenly between candidates. This quadratic relationship between vote and money is highly significant under the Kim Young Sam administration (1993– 1997) but not significant during the Kim Dae Jung administration (1998– 2002). ∗Prepared for delivery at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the Australasian Political Studies Association (Adelaide, September 29–October 1, 2004) and the Third International Conference of the Japan Economic Policy Association (Tokyo, November 13–14, 2004).

if contentious, point of debate in recent times”. A good deal of this debate
has thus far concentrated on the twin issues of labour unionisation and the
present system of centralised wage arbitration. In contrast, the related but
nevertheless crucial question of occupational licensing, particularly in the
so-called professions, has suffered a degree of relative neglect. It is this latter
aspect of labour market regulation which forms the subject matter of the
present paper.

"It is shown that the joint distribution of economic and political power plays a key role in determining regulatory and tax policies of national and subnational governments. If both economic and political power are evenly distributed across individuals, then regulatory and tax policies are efficient, but if they are unevenly distributed and positively correlated, then regulatory policy is used by subnational governments to redistribute income in favor of individuals with higher economic and political power at the expense of productivity and output. Consequently, the national government has to raise the tax rate to finance public expenditure. Moreover, if there exists a positive correlation between economic and political power, then the higher the fiscal gap, the larger the gap between equilibrium and efficient policies because subnational governments underestimate more the fall of public revenues caused by inefficient policies.",regulation and rent‐seeking: the role of the distribution of political and economic power,2017,Journal of Public Economic Theory,"Fernando Del Rio1, Francisco-Xavier Lores1University of Santiago de Compostela",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This thesis develops a public interest methodology for assessing the impact of regulatory reforms in microfinance, applies this methodology to the case study of Uganda and explains the results by analysing the political economy of policy change. It thus combines public and private interest approaches in assessing microfinance regulation. Firstly, the study develops a methodology for regulatory impact assessment based on the public interest theory of regulation. The first step is an analysis of market failures as the main rationale for regulation. Regulatory objectives are then defined with reference to these market failures. Finally, a variety of quantitative and qualitative impact indicators are identified to measure the benefits of regulation with reference to the achievement of the regulatory objectives while also considering the costs. Secondly, the thesis applies this rationale-objectives-indicators approach to the new legal framework for microfinance deposit-taking institutions (MDIs) in Uganda using similar, but unregulated microfinance institutions as a control group. The results show that the MDI regime‘s generally positive impact was only achieved at substantial cost to the regulator and regulated institutions and is skewed towards safety and soundness and systemic stability without adequate consideration of other objectives such as consumer protection and access. Thirdly, the thesis explains the degree to which public interest objectives were achieved by analysing the political economy of regulatory change. It shows that the three stakeholder groups with the best knowledge of microfinance regulation and whose interests were most closely aligned with the public interest objectives - the Central Bank (Bank of Uganda), the MDI candidates, and donor agencies - were also those who had the strongest influence on the policy change process. The thesis concludes that its unique contribution is to develop a thorough methodology for assessing regulatory impact in microfinance. The methodology is used to measure the strengths and weaknesses of the MDI regime in Uganda, while the political economy analysis explains why these strengths and weaknesses arose.",regulatory impact assessment in microfinance: a theoretical framework and its application to uganda,2010,NA,Stefan Staschen,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In this short paper I adopt the public choice school paradigm of modeling a government in order to compare its performance with that of the market in the standard model of the provision of public goods. Private provision is represented by the Cournot-Nash equilibrium in individual contributions. Public provision incorporates rent seeking, whereby some of the aspects of the allocation are determined indirectly by influence activities of the interested parties. Thus, both allocation procedures yield inefficiency, and the question is which procedure results in a greater amount of inefficiency: private provision with its free riding incentives, or public provision with its rent seeking incentives. The results indicate that public provision may well be preferred to private provision of public goods. Thus, superiority of private provision is not guaranteed even in the case of a non-benevolent government.

"In any society characterized by diversity and specialization, each citizen - the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker - is a special interest on some dimensions of public policy and a member of the general public on many other dimensions. Each citizen enjoys being at the receiving end of special interest handouts even at the expense of inefficiencies imposed on general public. But relative to the status quo involving inefficient redistribution on most dimensions of public policy, including many dimensions on which the citizen is a member of the general public, the vast majority of citizens would surely be better off if the government did not cater to special interests at all. With this common interest in place, why do democratic societies have such a hard time ridding themselves of special interest politics? This article argues that the driving force underlying special interest politics is an information asymmetry: each citizen has a precise idea about the special interest handouts she is receiving and a vague idea about the price she is paying, as a member of the general public, for inefficient redistribution. I explain why special interest politics are ultimately impervious to reform (though we can tame them at the margin); I examine the trade-offs inherent in reform efforts (what it costs to tame them); and I spell out why special interest politics can be a Good Thing (why we should not tame them all the way even if we could).",representative government and special interest politics,2003,Journal of Theoretical Politics,Susanne Lohmann,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"I develop a framework for applying existing formal models of restrictive amendment procedures in Congress to the study of the French government's use of two restrictive legislative procedures, the package vote and the “guillotine”. I test six hypotheses derived from existing formal models and from existing research on the French National Assembly. The analysis shows that the French government invokes the two procedures on the same types of distributive and jurisdictionally complex bills that frequently receive closed rules in Congress. The analysis also shows that the decision to use the restrictive procedures is strongly linked to the majority status of the government, suggesting they are used to preserve agreements between parties in the same way that restrictive amendment procedures are used to preserve agreements between individual members of Congress. Thus, existing formal models of legislative institutions can help us study how procedural structures shape strategic bargaining between political parties in parliamentary systems, especially during coalition and minority government.",restrictive legislative procedures in france and the united states.,1992,American Political Science Review,John D.

"In the economic literature various political institutions designed to control the government have been analyzed. However, an important institution has been neglected so far: independent auditing institutions with an extended mandate to analyze the budget draft and individual policy proposals. We argue that auditors with an extended mandate improve transparency and provide essential information on the impact of policy proposals on common pool resources. This leads to less wasteful spending and a more efficient allocation of public resources. We empirically analyze the policy impact of local auditors with an extended audit mandate in Switzerland. Auditors, who can evaluate and criticize policy proposals ex ante to policy decisions, significantly reduce the general tax burden and public expenditures.

"Much fiscal analysis of developing countries is on the following pattern: the academic literature is drawn on to construct a model fiscal system; the existing situation in a particular country is examined to determine how it diverges from the model; and a fiscal reform is then proposed to transform what is into what ought to be. This approach is deficient because it does not require sufficient detailed examination of existing reality to ensure that the assumptions postulated in the model are congruent with reality, that the recommended changes can in fact be implemented, or that, if implemented, they will in fact produce the desired results. In contrast, my approach is first to study in detail exactly how the existing system works, and why it works that way, in order to have a firm basis for understanding what changes may be both desirable and feasible.

"In 1979, when Margaret Thatcher came to power, publicly owned companies produced roughly 12 percent of GDP in the United Kingdom. By the time of the election of the Labour government in 1997, this figure had fallen to 2 percent. At least in the United Kingdom, public ownership seems to have been discredited. What were the origins of privatization in the United Kingdom? Was the policy the natural outcome of Conservative thinking, or was it a decisive break from the past? Why has privatization proved so enduring? Why is renationalization off the agenda? Did privatization raise productivity in the companies concerned? If it did not, what future steps concerning privatization or the privatized companies can be taken that might improve performance? This chapter addresses these questions.

"Formal fiscal rules have currently been introduced in several countries. In fact, a recent survey reveals that their number has risen from five in 1990 to almost 80 in 2012. While most studies focus on intra-jurisdictional effects of fiscal rules, vertical impacts on the finances of other levels of governments have yet to be thoroughly explored. Hence, this paper studies the influence of Swiss cantonal debt brakes on municipal finances. In order to investigate that matter, a unique database that encompasses the 141 largest Swiss municipalities and cities between the years 1982 and 2007 is examined in a panel analysis. The estimation results suggest that municipal expenditures and revenues significantly decreased in the aftermath of a cantonal debt brake implementation. This holds in particular, when the rigidity of the debt brake is strong, as well as when local spending on security, education, and health is considered",shift of public expenditures through debt brakes the swiss experience,2013,NA,"Heiko T.

"Economists prescribe well-known remedies for those situations where private behavior does not maximize allocational efficiency. Legislatures, however, rarely enact microeconomic policies without substantially altering economists' solutions. Those who defend elected officials' alterations offer three categories of justification--windfall losses of income negate efficiency improvements; indirect redistribution, though inefficient, serves progressive goals without generally repudiating market incomes; command-and-control regulation produces valuable symbolic outputs. Only the first line of argument has merit. Policy prescriptions often are insensitive to the wealth losses they create and can be improved through congressional attention to distributional issues. For the most part, however, no normative goal is well served when Congress ignores economic efficiency in the design of policies.",should congress listen to economists,1989,The Journal of Politics,Peter VanDoren1Princeton University,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This manuscript demonstrates that voters have nothing to be afraid of when new hard budget constraint legislation is implemented. Our claim is that this kind of legislation reduces the asymmetry of information between voters and incumbents over the budget and, as a consequence, the latter have incentives to increase the supply of public goods. As a nationwide institutional innovation, the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) is exogenous to all municipalities; therefore, there is no self-selection bias in its implementation. We show that public goods expenditure increases after the FRL. Second, this increase occurs in municipalities located in the country’s poorest region. Third, our findings can be extended to the supply of public goods because the higher the expenditure with health and education, the greater the probability of incumbents being re-elected. Finally, there exists a 'de facto' higher supply of public goods in education (number of per capita classrooms) after the FRL.",should voters be afraid of hard budget constraint legislation? fiscal responsibility law in brazilian municipalities,2010,NA,"Paulo Roberto Arvate, Carlos Pereira",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Because the American states operate under balanced budget requirements, increases in spending in one area typically entail equal and opposite budget cuts in other programs. The literature analysing the correlates of government spending by policy area has mostly ignored these trade-offs inherent to policymaking, failing to address one of the most politically interesting and important dimensions of fiscal policy. Borrowing from the statistical literature on compositional data, we present more appropriate and efficient methods that explicitly incorporate the budget constraint into models of spending by budget category. We apply these methods to eight categories of spending from the American states over the years 1984–2009 to reveal winners and losers in the scramble for government spending.

The empirical evidence confirms strategic interactions among suburban governments and the central city for public security spending. A 10% increase of the city?s security spending leads to a 3% decrease in security spending of the suburban communes in the Lucerne area.

"AbstractThis paper provides new evidence on bias in preference revelation and valuation of public goods. It does so through the systematic definition of free-rider, mixed-good, information and social choice problems and by a survey application to the case of valuing social benefit from the arts. These sources of bias are each found to be significant. It is also found that free-rider behaviour is random with respect to observable socio-demographic characteristics. Allowing for bias, aggregate public good benefit necessary for public support of arts is still established. The study therefore demonstrates not only the significance of free-rider and other biases in eliciting public good demand, but also practicable techniques for allowing for these effects via a survey method.",strategic bias and demand for public goods: theory and an application to the arts,1986,Journal of Public Economics,"C.D.

"A common interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity in the federalism literature is that decentralized government, which is closer to the people, is better able to respond to the preferences of its citizens. However, when the principle is denuded of its moral foundations in this fashion it not only fails to provide the grounding for achieving human dignity and the common good, but may also become the harbinger of fiscal crises and social dysfunction. We provide a more comprehensive account of the principle of subsidiarity and contrast this with various conceptions prominently presented in the federalism literature. We then explore how this more comprehensive view of subsidiarity would look in practice.

"This chapter follows a subjective approach for evaluating representation and examines “citizens’ feeling of being represented” by the national parliament and their representatives. The authors examine this subject in two ways. The first explanatory approach emphasizes the relevance of substantive representation. In short, the more positively citizens perceive themselves to be represented concerning their values, issue preferences or their concerns as a member of a social group, the more positively they will evaluate the institutions and actors of the representational process. The second approach focuses on the behavior of representatives. It predicts representational judgments based on perceptions of MPs’ behavior. The results show that both explanatory approaches are relevant in explaining citizens’ representational judgments, but also suggest that perceptions of substantive representation are slightly more important than perceptions of MPs’ behavior.",substance or behavior as links? : explaining representational judgments,2018,NA,"Mirjam Dageförde1, 2, Eric Kerrouche3, Corentin Poyet41Sciences Po, 2European University Institute, 3Institut d'études politiques de Bordeaux, 4University of Tampere",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"[From the introduction]. Increasing mobility of capital pressures governments around the world to remain attractive locations for investment. In order to attract new firms or to maintain existing ones, governments at national and subnational levels offer various forms of subsidies to firms including direct grants, tax breaks, worker training credits and free land. Competition to attract footloose capital creates similar pressures for governments around the world, resulting in subsidy races that lead governments to bid against one another with growing subsidy packages. There is considerable variation, however, in the level and type of subsidies governments offer. Among European countries which are similarly situated in the global economy, for instance, Austria and the Netherlands provide subsidies for research and development, Portugal, France and Ireland focus on aiding specific manufacturing sectors, and Belgium and Italy stress regional assistance. What explains this variation in government support to businesses? In this paper, I argue that the mobility of capital in the economy and the domestic institutions and politics influence the level and type of subsidies offered by a government.",supporting industries in the age of globalization and regionalization: state aid in the european union,2007,NA,Umut.

"In the last decades, the majority of OECD countries has experienced a continuous increase in public debt. The European debt crisis has prompted a fundamental re‐evaluation of public debt sustainability and the looming threat of sovereign debt default. Due to a multitude of large scale events in its past, Germany is far from being an exception: In fact, Germany’s peacetime debt‐to‐GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio has never been higher. In this paper, we analyse the sustainability of Germany’s public finances against the standard theoretical back‐ground using a unique database, retrieved from multiple sources covering the period from 1850 to 2010. Multiple currency crises and external events offer anecdotal evidence, contradicting the historical perception of Germany as the poster child of European public finance. Given these corresponding breaks in time series, the empirical analysis is conducted for the sub‐periods 1872‐1913 and 1950‐2010. In addition to an anecdotal his‐torical analysis, we conduct formal tests on fiscal sustainability, including tests on stationarity and cointegration and the estimation of Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Models (VECM). While we cannot reject the hypothesis that fiscal policy was sustainable in the period before the First World War, the tests allow for a rejection of the hypothesis of fiscal sustainability for the period from 1950 to 2010. This evidence leads to the conclusion that Germany’s public debt is in dire need of consolidation. Albeit a much needed reform, the incompleteness of the German debt brake will have to be addressed in the coming years, in order to ensure that fiscal consolidation actually takes place.",sustainability of german fiscal policy and public debt: historical and time series evidence for the period 1850-2010,2013,NA,"Heiko T.

"Models of fiscal federalism rarely account for the efficiency implications of intergovernmental fiscal ties for federal tax policy. This paper shows that fiscal institutions such that federal tax deductibility, vertical revenue-sharing, and fiscal equalization (being common features of existing federations) encourage local taxation, but may discourage federal taxation. Furthermore, the structure of public spending is skewed towards local spending. We also show that, when considering Leviathan governments, fiscal institutions reduce confiscatory taxation by the federal government. The result is contrary to the Cartelization Hypothesis (Brennan and Buchanan 1980).

"In one sense the public choice revolution of the 20th century ocurred because economic and political analysis now routinely takes into account the incentives of political decision-makers, and recognizes that political decision-making can result in inefficiencies. In another sense, this public choice revolution is seriously incomplete, because while it has succeeded in producing a theory of government failure, it has not taken the next step to develop a framework for optimal public policy in light of the characteristics of collective decision-making. This chapter takes a step in that direction by sketching out optimal policies for taxation, production and redistribution, taking into account that these public policies are products of the political system.

The size of government spending decreases as the level of seniorityincreasesfromlowtomoderate,whileitincreasesasthelevelofseniorityincreases from moderate to high. The model also predicts that the equilibrium level of seniority is moderate. Building on these predictions, we hypothesize that the adoption of term limits resulting in a small reduction of seniority has little impact on government expenditures because the level of seniority remains to be moderate. In contrast, the adoption of term limits that dramatically reduces the level of seniority will increase the size of government spending because the level of seniority changes from moderate to low. We test these hypotheses drawn from the model using the panel data of the American states between 1980 and 2004.","term limits, seniority, and government spending: theory and evidence from the u.s. states ⁄",2011,NA,"Yasushi Asako, Tetsuya Matsubayashi1, Michiko UedaUniversity of North Texas",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The 1997 East Asian Economic Crisis not only significantly affected themacroeconomy, but also opened a new era for the political economy in Thailand. Thispaper tries to explore this new era from various theoretical points of view. One crucialfeature in this new era is the 1997 Constitution. The argument is that under the newpolitical institution, the Thai state was, on the one hand, in a relatively strong positionto shift itself towards being a developmentalist state; on the other, it also generatedrent-seeking behaviour. This study examines the case of Thaksin Shinawatra and hisgovernment.

"This article revisits the German system of fiscal federalism between unification in 1871 and hyper-inflation in 1923. I argue that the ill designed fiscal system led to systematically excessive debt for the Reich. The system was the outcome of overlapping distributional conflicts between centre and states, and between capital and labour. It was also responsible for the debt problems arising in World War I and the unsuccessful attempts at fiscal reforms during and after the war. Ultimately, these distributional conflicts contributed to the hyper-inflation in Germany. The German example also has implications for the debate about fiscal federalism in the European Union.",the agony of central power: fiscal federalism in the german reich,2001,European Review of Economic History,Carsten Hefeker1University of Basel,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Proportional election systems are widespread across countries and often lead to coalition governments. This creates interest in how the form of government (single-party or coalition governments) causally influences fiscal policies. It is difficult to estimate this causal effect empirically because the form of government is not randomly assigned to political units. I overcome this problem by using a Regression Kink Design which exploits that there is a slope change in the treatment probability at the 50% vote share of the strongest party. This method is applied to a large panel data set of German local governments. I find that contrary to the theoretical prediction, coalition governments significantly decrease expenditures.",the causal effect of coalition governments on fiscal policies: evidence from a regression kink design,2014,Applied Economics,"Sebastian Garmann1Ruhr Graduate School in Economics (RGS Econ) and University of Dortmund (TU), Chair of Public Economics, Vogelpothsweg 87, Dortmund, Germany",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The central planning agencies in Latin America have undergone multiple transformations in their structural design. These agencies came to life during the late 1950s in response to a development strategy that required the state to provide long-run direction to development by means of economic planning. Five decades later, the same agencies were redeployed to perform an open-market development strategy. What explains the fact that the same agency, created with the purpose of planning economic development, has functioned across time and governments with sharp economic, and political differences?

"This paper analyzes whether the Congressional budget process (instituted in 1974) leads to lower aggregate spending than does the piece-meal appropriations process that preceded it. Previous theoretical analysis, using spatial models of legislator preferences, is inconclusive. This paper uses a model of interest group lobbying, where a legislature determines spending on a national public good and on subsidies to subsets of the population that belong to nationwide sector-specific interest groups. In the appropriations process, the Appropriations Committee proposes a budget, maximizing the joint welfare of voters and the interest groups, that leads to overspending on subsidies. In the budget process, a Budget Committee proposes an aggregate level of spending (the budget resolution); the Appropriations Committee then proposes a budget. If the lobby groups are not subject to a binding resource constraint, the two institutional structures lead to identical outcomes. With such a constraint, however, there is a free rider problem among the groups in lobbying the Budget Committee, as each group only obtains a small fraction of the benefits from increasing the aggregate budget. If the number of groups is sufficiently large, each takes the budget resolution as given, and lobbies only the Appropriations Committee. The main results are that aggregate spending is lower, and social welfare higher, under the budget process; however, provision of the public good is suboptimal. The paper also presents two extensions: the first endogenizes the enforcement of the budget resolution by incorporating the relevant procedural rules into the model. The second analyzes statutory budget rules that limit spending levels, but can be revised by a simple majority vote. In each case,the free rider problem prevents the groups from securing the required changes to procedural and budget rules.",the congressional budget process and the aggregate level of spending,2002,NA,Dhammika Dharmapala1University of Connecticut,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Large areas of northern Oklahoma were hit by severe storms and flooding in the first two weeks of June 2008. Property damage was estimated to total more than $759 million, an astounding $198 for every resident of Oklahoma. (1) That same summer Missouri also experienced severe storms and flooding. Property damage totaled $17 million, or about $3 per capita. Crop damage totaled an additional $58 million, bringing the total damage to roughly $14 per capita. Counties in both states were declared to be ""federal disaster areas"" by President George W. Bush, making affected jurisdictions eligible for federal reimbursement of 75% for eligible recovery and rebuilding expenses. President Bush increased the federal cost share for Missouri to 90% of eligible costs a few weeks after the flooding while Oklahoma did not receive this extra assistance. President Bush's decision to increase the federal reimbursement percentage sent an extra $8 million to Missouri. Why did Missouri receive more favorable treatment than Oklahoma? The Oklahoma storms had a much greater financial impact on the state, and they definitely could have used the additional assistance they would have received in reimbursement at the 90% level. Partisan politics provides a plausible explanation. Missouri was widely expected to be a pivotal swing state in that fall's presidential election, and this proved true with only 3,903 votes separating John McCain and Barack Obama. There was no danger of Republicans losing Oklahoma, which McCain ended up carrying with a 31% margin over Obama. I study the effects of presidential electoral politics on the federal government's financial response to disasters. Specifically I ask whether states supportive of the president or ""swing states"" are more likely to receive additional disaster aid through presidentially ordered increases in the federal reimbursement rate after specific disasters. To answer this question I construct an original data set including information about presidential decisions regarding disaster aid for 945 disasters spanning 19 years and three presidential administrations (Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama). I find that presidents are more likely to send additional aid to swing states and most significantly that the presidents in this study used their power in different ways, likely due in part to contrasting electoral strategies. These findings demonstrate the presence of partisan political calculations in the distribution of disaster aid, a power delegated to the president by Congress precisely to avoid such occurrences. This article begins with a theoretical overview of distributive politics and the executive branch. Two theories are borrowed from the congressional literature as ways in which policy makers may wield policy power in a partisan way. Swing voter theory expects policy makers to focus on swing states while coalition maintenance expects policy makers to focus on rewarding their base states as a means of ensuring high turnout. Additionally, the impact of co-partisan presidents and governors, as well as proximity of the next presidential election, are tested as additional partisan factors with the potential to influence the distribution of disaster aid. Theorizing about Presidents and Distributive Politics Weingast, Shepsle, and Johnsen (1981) define distributive politics as policy areas with ""project-by-project orientation, the geographic concentration of benefits, and the diffusion of costs"" (681). In this article distributive politics implies disproportionate benefits relative to the burdens to geographic constituencies. This fits the nature of disaster relief, as disasters are inherently local or regional events, yet the federal government routinely provides relief and is expected to do so. Distributive Politics and Congress The vast majority of the early work related to distributive politics focuses on the ability of senators and representatives in Congress to direct funds to specific constituencies. …",the contemporary presidency: presidents profiting from disasters: evidence of presidential distributive politics,2013,Presidential Studies Quarterly,Nicholas R.

"Several characteristics of a political system have been identified as increasing the cost of governing, such as presidentialism, federalism, an open list with proportional representation, a multiparty system, and coalition governments. Although Brazil suffers from all of these “pathologies,” the authors argue that other characteristics of the Brazilian system have the opposite effect and allow high levels of governability at low cost. In particular, the authors examine the role of legislators’ amendments to the budget, which provide the executive a low-cost means of obtaining support. The authors provide evidence that the Brazilian president routinely uses his or her powers to reward and punish legislators for supporting or opposing his or her interests in Congress. Although legislators have a limited role in the budgetary process, that role can have important electoral consequences for their political careers.",the cost of governing strategic behavior of the president and legislators in brazil's budgetary process,2004,Comparative Political Studies,"Carlos Pereira1, Bernardo Mueller21University of São Paulo, 2University of Brasília",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"One of the well-established models of public choice is the distributive model of politics, which explains how narrow special interests are able to use the democratic political process to produce legislation for their own private benefit. Economic analysis of the problems of special interest politics is relatively recent,' suggesting that the problem may not have been recognized until recently.2 Higgs [8] notes that big government in the United States is a 20th century phenomenon, and carefully documents a shift in the dominant ideology in the progressive era prior to World War I that, he argues, set the stage for rampant government growth. Similarly, Anderson and Hill [1] trace the birth of the transfer society back to the 1877 Munn v. Illinois case that allowed the Illinois legislature to regulate grain elevator rates. Hughes [ 11], on the other hand, argues that Americans have always had the governmental habit, and that special interest programs have always been produced by the federal government. These two theses are not necessarily inconsistent: a trickle of special interest legislation in the 19th century might have set the stage for rampant government growth in the 20th century.3 The existence of pork-barrel politics in the late 20th century is beyond question, but there is a legitimate question about when it began, and about whether it is a direct result of the design of government specified in the U.S. Constitution. If problems of special interest politics began with Munn v. Illinois, as Anderson and Hill [1] suggest, or during the progressive era, as argued by Higgs [8], then the question arises regarding why the same fundamental political structure did not produce pork-barrel programs until then. However, this paper finds evidence in the Constitution of the Confederate States of America that special interest problem was well-recognized before the Civil War.

"Prior research suggests that co-partisan legislators and governors in control of state government direct public funds for projects and programs toward localities where their party attains high levels of electoral support. While we typically equate distributive goods with concrete projects, public education finance may also be subject to partisan manipulation. One opportunity for legislators and governors to influence the design of education funding schemes arises when a state’s school finance system is declared unconstitutional in a state’s supreme court (Berry and Wysong 2012). This paper examines whether, in the wake of judicial interventions that have occurred in many U.S. states since the 1970s, transfers from states to local areas for the purposes of education were geographically targeted to co-partisan localities when one party controlled state government. The evidence presented is suggestive of a partisan pattern of school financing in the period following the courts’ judgments.",the distributive politics of education policy: party control of state government and transfers to localities,2012,NA,Melissa Sands1Harvard University,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The 1999-2006 versions of the Italian Domestic Stability Pact had many shortcomings and a modest impact with respect to the aim of aligning the fiscal behaviour of sub-national government units with the national commitments under the European Stability and Growth Pact. The Domestic Pact was revised in 2007 and 2008 to tighten the monitoring and sanctions framework and prevent some inefficient behaviour. However, some undesirable features still mar the new regime: no coordination exists between the Domestic Pact and the debt and tax constraints applied to local governments; a clear definition of the contribution of sub-national governments to aggregate compliance with the external rule is still lacking; flexibility has been introduced by means of an artificial reference budget balance; side effects on resource redistribution are ignored; and monitoring and sanctioning remain weak. Remedies for the above shortcomings can possibly be found in the domestic pacts of the other EMU countries. Most of all, the Domestic Pact should be adjusted to the specific characteristics of fiscal decentralization in Italy, where a large fiscal gap exists, revenue autonomy is constrained and a large share of the responsibility for spending is rigid and politically sensitive.",the domestic stability pact in italy: a rule for discipline?,2009,NA,"Luisa Giuriato1, Francesca Gastaldi1Sapienza University of Rome",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Competition between political parties is a process that unfolds over time whereas formal theories of party competition have tended to take an essentially static, or one-shot, approach.

This is done using a differential game theory model to analyse a situation in which support for a party depends on the amount spent on marketing relative to the expenditure of the other party. One of the main results is that, even when voters are not myopic, the logic of the competition forces parties to accelerate expenditure on campaigning during the period between elections.

"The crisis of the sovereign debt forced the Portuguese government to reach out for joint financial help from the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) stresses the need for a major redefinition of the Portuguese local government system. Currently, the Portuguese local government is structured in two tiers (308 municipalities and 4259 parishes), both with an executive and deliberative elected bodies. The Portuguese government was asked to present a plan to amalgamate these local entities in order to enhance service delivery, improve efficiency and reduce costs. The main argument used is that excessive territorial fragmentation undermines efficiency and precludes scale economies. The main objective of the paper is to test two competing hypotheses regarding local government spending present in the consolidation/fragmentation literature. The Tiebout (1956) tradition argues that fragmentation induces lower spending through competition between local governments offering different taxes-services packages – the Leviathan model (Brennan and Buchanan 1980). This argument is in sharp opposition with the supporters of amalgamations arguing that territorial centralization can produce economies of scale and significant cost savings, reduce overlaps, and promote better accountability (Rosenfeld and Reese 2004). These hypotheses are tested with data collected from all 278 local governments of continental Portugal. We measure local government spending both in terms of total expenditures and grant transfers to parish governments and territorial fragmentation as the number of parish governments per 1000 individuals. Our findings show that higher levels of fragmentation lead to increased local government expenditures and transfers to parish governments, thus suggesting that the amalgamation proposed by the MoU and mandated by national legislation is likely to induce cost savings and improve financial sustainability.",the economic and political impacts of top-down territorial reforms: the case of portuguese parishes,2012,NA,"António F.

"This report provides a review of the literature on priority setting in healthcare. It adopts an economic perspective on the problem of choosing the optimal portfolio of programs that can be afforded from a limited national healthcare budget. The traditional economic approach, proposes maximizing health gain (however measured) subject to a budget constraint, which implies ranking programs according to their cost-effectiveness ratio. However, our critical review suggests that this traditional approach is subject to three important difficulties: limitations in economic evaluation methodology, incorporating equity principles, and practical constraints. These suggest a need for a fundamental rethink of the role of cost-effectiveness analysis in priority setting. Methodological concerns include identifying whose perspective to adopt, the generalizability of results to multiple settings, the treatment of uncertainty and timing, and the treatment of interactions between programs. Most equity considerations can be captured in two broad headings: equity related to some concept of need and equity related to access to services. In principle equity concerns can be incorporated into an economic approach to priority setting with relative ease. However we find that many contributions to the debate on equity concepts are theoretical and remote from practical implementation issues. The traditional cost-effectiveness approach generally ignores the numerous practical constraints arising from the political, institutional, and environmental context in which priority setting takes place. These include the influence of interest groups, the transaction costs associated with policy changes, and the interactions between the provision and financing of health services. We find that treatment of such political economy perspectives is the least well-developed aspect of the priority setting literature and suggest some rudimentary models that could serve as a starting point for analysis",the economics of priority setting for health care: a literature review,2004,NA,"Maria Goddard1, Katharina Hauck1, Peter C.

"There is an intensive dispute in political economics about the impact of institutions on income redistribution. While the main focus is on comparison between different forms of representative democracy, the influence of direct democracy on redistribution has attracted much less attention. In this paper, employing both a composite index and measures of single institutions, we find that direct democracy is particularly associated with lower welfare spending. Moreover, we estimate a model which explains the determinants of achieved redistribution measured by Gini coefficients using panel data provided by the Swiss Federal Tax Office from 1981 to 1997. While our results indicate that less public funds are used to redistribute income and actual redistribution is lower, inequality is not reduced to a lesser extent in direct than in representative democracies for a given initial income distribution.",the effect of direct democratic institutions on income redistribution: evidence for switzerland,2007,NA,"Lars P.

"Theorists have long argued that democratic policymakers respond to political pressures from their constituents. Although empirical work generally supports that broad contention, heterogeneity prevails both in theoretical work and empirically across country-times over exactly what comprises the constituency to which policymakers respond. We propose conceiving the potential bases of democratic representation as a continuum from the interests of the policymaker's geographic constituency, her electoral district, d, to those of her party's supporters, her partisan constituency, p. The effective constituency, c, to which democratic policymakers respond would then be some convex combination of these partisan and geographic extremes, with the partisan weight summarized by the degree to which parties are able to act as strategic units and receive their electoral support as units, i.e., of party unity, u. That is, heuristically, we conceptualize c=u*p+(1-u)*d. Re-examination of the familiar Weingast-Shepsle-Johnsen (WSJ) model of distributive politics and pork-barrel spending (the law of 1/n) motivates the analysis and undergirds empirical evaluation of our conception of the effective constituency. Postwar histories of public spending and distributive politics in developed democracies seem not to support a pure-electoral- district WSJ model, but postwar public spending in the United States, where data best-suited to evaluate the argument exist, does support a WSJ model as modified to reflect our conception of the effective constituency. We conclude with some ideas for extending the basic effective constituency notion beyond partisan and geographic bases of representation and for incorporating more explicitly and directly into empirical specification of public-policy models certain theoretical propositions that purport to explain aspects of the political-economic institutional, structural, and strategic context, such as the degree of party unity, that shape how policymakers allocate their efforts across public-good, redistributive, distributive, and rent-seeking activities. We consider several such arguments relating political-economic institutional, structural, and strategic contexts to the degree of party unity and of geographic versus partisan representation, and thereby to policymakers' weight on each type of policy activity, and show how to embed and test such arguments within estimable empirical models of public spending using the effective constituency concept.","the effective constituency in (re)distributive politics: alternative bases of democratic representation, geographic versus partisan",2004,NA,"Robert J.

There are no property rights attached to these institutions. Therefore, politicians need to remain in control if they are to reap the full benefits of reform. When the probability of re-election is unaffected by the reform choice, political polarisation between incumbent and challenger results in a lower critical value for the cost of investment by reducing the benefits of reform compared to a benchmark of no uncertainty. The reduction in the cut-off rate is increasing in the degree of polarisation.

"An electronic circuit includes a dynamic regulator connected to a load and a dc-to-dc converter to reduce a need for bulky and expensive capacitors which would otherwise be required to suppress transients. The dynamic regulator comprises one or both of a current source circuit for actively sourcing current to the load during load current demand transients, and a current sink circuit for actively sinking current from the load during load current excess transients. The dynamic regulator preferably senses the load voltage, and tracks the load voltage. The current source circuit preferably includes a current source switch, and a current source controller for operating the current source switch responsive to the load voltage falling rapidly with respect to the tracked load voltage. In a similar fashion, the current sinking circuit may include a current sink switch, and a current sink controller for operating the current source switch responsive to the load voltage rising quickly above the tracked load voltage.

"Rough Draft: Do not quote or circulate without permission Equilibrium Federal Impotence: Why the States and Not the American National Government Financed Infrastructure Investment in the Antebellum Era John Wallis and Barry R. Weingast * January 2005 1. Introduction Limited government is widely agreed to be important to the promotion of economic development (Knack and Keefer 199*, North and Weingast 1989, Shleifer and Vishny 2000). Yet the mechanisms that sustain limited government remain to be established. In this paper, we explore this question in the context of the early United States, enquiring about the institutions and incentives that both limited the scope of the national government and promoted the public provision of market-enhancing public goods. Madison and the other founding fathers created a Constitutional system of limited government by pitting ambition against ambition – but how did this work in practice? Specifically, how did the incentives facing public officials limit their ability to exercise political power?

"Contrary to simple theoretical predictions, previous empirical research has found that state government public spending is increased far more, often dollar-for-dollar, by federal grant receipts than by equivalent increases in constituent private income. This anomaly has come to be known as the flypaper effect. First, a legislative bargaining model developed in this paper provides a critique of this empirical finding. The model demonstrates a positive correlation between constituent preferences for public goods and intergovernmental grant receipts, and this correlation has likely biased the existing literature towards finding a flypaper effect. The model also motivates using measures of the political power of state congressional delegations as an instrument for grant receipts. Second, after correcting for the endogeneity of grant receipts, the results demonstrate that constituent private income and grants have similar effects on public spending.",the flypaper effect unstuck: evidence on endogenous grants from the federal highway aid program,2000,Social Science Research Network,Brian G.

" How does the electoral geography of legislative districts affect pork barreling? This article presents a formal model extending
 Mayhew's classic credit-claiming theory to account for the electoral geography of bicameralism. Under bicameralism, upper
 chamber (Senate) and lower chamber (Assembly) legislators who share overlapping constituencies must collaborate to bring
 home pork projects. Collaboration is easier between a Senator and an Assembly Member who share a large fraction of their
 constituents and thus have relatively aligned electoral incentives. But dividing a Senate district into a larger number of
 Assembly district fragments misaligns these electoral incentives for collaboration, thus reducing equilibrium pork spending.
 Hence, increased Senate district fragmentation causes a decrease in equilibrium spending. I exploit the 2002 New York
 Senate expansion as a natural experiment, examining how sudden changes in the geographic fragmentation of Senate
 districts account for differences in the distribution of pork earmarks immediately before and after the redrawing of district
 boundaries.",the geographical targeting of pork barrel earmarks in bicameral legislatures,2013,NA,Jowei Chen1University of Michigan,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1149

"The United States has witnessed changing trends, over the past few
decades, in the fiscal behavior and responsibilities of federal, state,
and local governments. In particular, two of the more politically
popular trends include a general movement of fiscal responsibility
away from the federal level toward the state and local level and an
attempt to implement budgetary mechanisms that instill fiscal discipline at the state and local level. Proponents of these fiscal discipline
mechanisms argue that these tools have been or will be effective at
slowing the rate of spending at all levels of government.1 The general
assumption is that these budget rules will provide the citizenry with
some protection against the inherent bias toward excess spending in
public-sector decisionmaking. This notion is based on the assumption
that state and local governments are more responsive to the needs of

"The Great Recession resulted in fiscal crises for governments across the Western world. Significant cuts in government programs were initiated as many governments scrambled to reduce their growing budget deficits. This article explores how European governments reacted during the recent crisis. In particular, the authors focus on the interlinkages between shifts toward more centralized decision making. The article uses a survey of thousands of public sector executives in 17 European countries. The authors find evidence of a centralization cascade, such that centralizing one element of the decision-making process leads to greater centralization throughout the system. Results also show that having a high number of organizational goals and facing clear sanctions for failing to achieve goals lead to greater centralization, but greater organizational commitment reduces the need to centralize.",the impact of fiscal crisis on decision‐making processes in european governments: dynamics of a centralization cascade,2015,Public Administration Review,"Ringa Raudla1, James W.

"We analyze how having an incumbent among candidates affects electoral turnout. We use a rich data set providing information on the electoral results of Italian municipal elections over the period 1993-2011. Endogeneity issues are handled through an instrumental variable approach using the mayor term-limit as an instrument for the presence of the incumbent mayor among candidates. Controlling for electoral competition, we find that the impact of incumbency is heterogeneous across geographical areas: incumbency increases turnout in the South of Italy, whereas we do not find any statistically significant effect in the North. As the positive effect holds true only for southern municipalities endowed with low levels of social capital we speculate that this is the result of incumbent politicians using their resources to establish clienteles.",the impact of incumbency on turnout: evidence from italian municipalities,2016,Electoral Studies,"Marco Alberto De Benedetto1, Maria De Paola21Birkbeck, University of London, 2University of Calabria",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We study the impact of numerical expenditure rules on the propensity of governments to deviate from expenditure targets in response to surprises in cyclical conditions. Theoretical considerations suggest that due to political fragmentation in the budgetary process expenditure policy might be prone to a pro-cyclical bias. However, this tendency may be mitigated by numerical expenditure rules. These hypotheses are tested against data from a panel of EU Member States. Our key findings are that (i) deviations between actual and planned government expenditure are positively related to unanticipated changes in the output gap, and (ii) numerical expenditure rules reduce this pro-cyclical bias. Moreover, the pro-cyclical spending bias is found to be particularly pronounced for spending items with a high degree of budgetary flexibility.

"Though the relationship between local government structure and expenditure has received considerable attention, there is little consensus as to how the features of representative government affect local expenditure. An exception is city council size, which has consistently been found to be positively related to spending. Previous results rely on cross-sectional estimation which may be subject to omitted variable bias. This paper analyzes three components of municipal governments—the form of government, the size of the city council, and the election method of city councilors.

The logic of the delegated power depends as much on the structure governing the superior (the civilian authorities) as that governing the specialized subordinate (the military organizations). This model proposes that the differences in adaptability demonstrated by British and American military organizations in response to similar threats can be explained by the distinct structure of civilian institutions and their effect on the development of military organizations.",the institutional sources of military doctrine: hegemons in peripheral wars,1993,International Studies Quarterly,Deborah D.

"African politics are often said to be dominated by ethnic divides, with the ensuing policies implemented by leaders being based almost exclusively on their ethnic power base. In this paper, we demonstrate that the identity of leaders matters for the attribution of development projects in the context of one of the largest Community-Driven Development (CDD) programs in Senegal. After showing that leadership matters, we consider its determinants by focusing on those factors that determine who becomes president and vice-president of a Conseil rural, the smallest administrative unit in Senegal, and which is elected by universal suffrage. We also consider the link between power in the Conseil rural and that in the Conseil de Concertation et de Gestion (CCG), an assembly coopted by the Conseil rural president that is typical of local institutions set up in the context of CDD programs, and which is responsible for the attribution of development projects to individual villages. Using a unique dataset, we show that ethnicity plays almost no role in determining who becomes president (or vice-president) of a Conseil rural and vice-president of the CCG, while party politics, age, political experience, village loyalty, and educational and professional qualifications do. Our results highlight the crucial importance, in terms of development policy, of the local political institutions that are often created alongside CDD programs.","the making of a (vice-) president: party politics, ethnicity, village loyalty and community-driven development",2008,NA,Jean-Louis Arcand1Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Federalism is widely lauded for its ability to manage deep social divisions and promote efficient policy in democratic systems, but it has been criticized for its impact on party system nationalization. In this paper, we explore the role of formal and informal institutions on party system nationalization in the Mexican political system, focusing on legislative politics. In Mexico, an end of one-party rule transformed the nature of center–periphery relations, empowering subnational actors and giving them incentives to act on the national stage. Using an original dataset, we show that these changes resulted in national parties dividing along state lines on policy decisions, and that the magnitude of these divisions depends primarily on 1) the informal centralization of career resources, 2) the extent to which parties are ideological and programmatic, and 3) the personal vote incentives of electoral rules.",the new federalism of mexico's party system,2012,Journal of Politics in Latin America,"Francisco Cantú1, Scott Desposato1University of California, San Diego",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1161

"The literatures on the performance of federal systems divide around three central questions. The first concerns the economic performance of federalism; the second, the political performance; and the third, the sources of stability for federal arrangements.

Economists typically focus on the first question, with an emphasis on the normative aspects, such as: How ought federalism to be designed? In answering this question, the economic theory of federalism provides a theory about the optimal organization of the state, addressing issues, such as what powers should be assigned to what levels of government; why should not the central government do everything? This literature has strong positive implications, for it also explains the economic implications of alternative divisions of powers among the various levels of government.","the performance and stability of federalism, mexican style: an institutionalist perspective",2003,NA,"Barry R.

Results confirm the hypotheses that, besides economic conditions, fragmentation of decision-making, ideology of the party in government, and closeness to elections affect fiscal policy in general and adjustment strategies in particular. During the nineties, the ideology of the party in government has become the most powerful predictor of fiscal policies and strategies of adjustment.

Our main objective here is to examine whether state governments’ fiscal behavior can partly be explained by the political attributes and the institutional characteristics of the government and of the legislature. In particular, we will try to analyze whether the incentives for the state governments to observe a prudent spending behavior have not been undermined by the fact that they have been able to influence relevant central government decisions regarding their finance. Our estimations results show that states that are overrepresented at the executive level tend to have higher spending and deficits. However, we don’t find any correlation between overrepresentation at the Parliament and states governments’ fiscal outcomes.

"If there has been a dominant trend in the evolution of the modern industrial societies of this century it has been the growing importance of government in the allocation of social resources. It is important that we appreciate the fundamentally political nature of the formation of government economic policy. This survey reviews and assesses our present understanding of how the political system might shape a nation's fiscal policy. Our approach is eclectic, drawing both from economics and political science, and decidedly micro-analytic in its orientation. From economics we adopt the perspective of utility maximizing agents and the analytics of trade, agreement, and market failure. From political science we learn just how and when these individual agents might act collectively to provide public goods, redistribute income, or issue government debt. Together the micro-analytics of economics and political science form the core theory of the 'new' political economy and provide a framework for understanding the emergence, and the performance, of governments.

"This paper surveys the recent literature on the political economy of fiscal policy, in particular the accumulation of government debt. We examine three possible determinants of fiscal balances: opportunistic behavior by policymakers, heterogeneous fiscal preferences of either voters or politicians, and budget institutions. We focus on the contributions of the last 10 years and emphasize findings related to developing countries. We include a recent body of literature on the fiscal preferences of voters, which, interestingly, seems to suggest that voters do not favor high-spending governments. We also report some original empirical evidence. First, we test different hypotheses from the political economy literature in a simultaneous manner for a large set of both developed and developing countries. We find that less-fragmented governments and a greater ability of voters to monitor fiscal policy are related to lower deficits; the estimated effects are larger than when the two hypotheses are evaluated separately, as the existing literature does. Second, we suggest the role of the courts in the determination of fiscal policy as a promising new avenue of research, and present some suggestive novel evidence on the importance of this channel.",the political economy of fiscal policy: survey,2006,NA,Marcela Eslava1University of Los Andes,Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1168
Many local public goods are allocated by federal governments using fixed regional shares: every region is entitled a fixed share of the total budget for a particular type of public good. This paper compares this fixed regional sharing rule with two alternative allocation rules: first best and common pool allocation. We find that the fixed regional sharing rule performs relatively well if the regional shares are reasonable. Legislative bargaining theory is used to study the determination of the fixed regional shares.,the political economy of fixed regional investment shares with an illustration for belgian railway investments,2010,NA,"Stef Proost1, Vera Zaporozhets21Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 2Center for Economic Studies",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1169
"In the 1980s scholars began applying Positive Political Theory (PPT) to study public law. This chapter summarizes that body of research and its relationship to other schools of legal thought. Like Law and Economics, PPT of Law uses sequential game theory to examine how rules and procedures shape policy and evaluates these outcomes from the perspective of economic efficiency. Like the Legal Process School in traditional legal scholarship, PPT of Law focuses on how the structure and process of legislative, bureaucratic and judicial decision-making influences the law and evaluates these procedures using the principle of democratic legitimacy; however, rather than using procedural norms derived from moral and political philosophy to evaluate procedures, PPT of Law conceptualizes the decision-making procedures of government as rationally designed by elected officials to shape the policies arising from decisions by executive agencies, the courts, and future elected officials.

"The presidential politics literature depicts presidents either as all-powerful actors or figureheads and seeks to explain outcomes accordingly. The president and the executive branch are nonetheless usually treated as black boxes, particularly in developing countries, even though the presidency has evolved into an extremely complex branch of government.

To help close the knowledge gap and explore differences in policymaking characteristics not only between Latin America and the US but also across Latin American countries, this paper summarizes the vast literature on the organization and resources of the Executive Branch in the Americas and sets a research agenda for the study of Latin American presidencies.",the presidency and the executive branch in latin america: what we know and what we need to know,2011,NA,"Alejandro Bonvecchi1, Carlos Scartascini21Torcuato di Tella University, 2Inter-American Development Bank",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Local government systems across the world face acute and ongoing fiscal challenges. In Australia, the regulatory response has focused squarely on council consolidation. This has, unfortunately, meant that comparatively little attention has been paid to alternate, less disruptive methods for enhancing municipal sustainability. One such possibility lies in modifying the structure of local political representation. We conduct a number of estimations on a four-year panel of Victorian municipal data to test whether the “law of 1/n” has empirical support at the local government level. Our results clearly show that the number of geographically defined fragments, or wards, within a given municipality is a statistically significant determinant of local government expenditure. A number of public policy recommendations follow from the empirical evidence that might be broadly applicable to other municipal systems.",the price of democracy? political representation structure and per capita expenditure in victorian local government:,2017,Urban Affairs Review,"Joseph Drew1, Brian Dollery1University of New England (Australia)",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Studies of distributive politics in the modern Congress have wrestled with the interplay between political parties, presidential and executive branch inuence, and committee power in allocating federal funds to states and congressional districts. It is widely accepted that most legislators anticipate an electoral benet for successfully steering pork to their constituents, but the literature has produced inconsistent evidence demonstrating an electoral advantage for pork and has found largely conditional eects for the role of congressional parties and the executive branch. This paper advances our understanding of distributive and partisan politics, as well as congressional development more generally, by looking to an earlier era of congressional history. Using original data on the construction of public buildings I describe the unfolding of a precursor to modern-style pork-barrel politics. Moreover, analysis of the factors determining how party and committee leaders distributed federal benets among the increasingly-careerist legislators of the time reveals the nature of partisan and electoral considerations in even the pre-modern Congress.",the public buildings boom: distributive and partisan politics in the modernizing congress,2015,NA,Charles J.

"Current proposals to address the European sovereign debt crisis envision some sort of fiscal union to complement the Economic and Monetary Union, backed by stronger sanctions against countries that deviate from budget balance. We argue that sanctions are an indirect approach to balancing budgets, and that member states, and Europe as a whole, could instead consider delegating effective fiscal instruments with a direct budgetary impact to an independent authority. Outside of a fiscal union, a solvent country could establish an independent fiscal authority at the national level, with a mandate to maintain long-term budget balance. Delegating a few powerful fiscal instruments to an institution of this type could cut off speculation about fiscal sustainability without ceding sovereignty to a supranational body. Inside a fiscal union, delegating one or more fiscal levers of each Eurozone member state to a national or European fiscal authority could eliminate moral hazard without relying on sanctions per se. Many fiscal instruments can serve to balance budgets, but in the context of a monetary union the chosen instrument should ideally be one that increases competitiveness when recession looms. The instrument should also be one that is quick and simple to adjust, with a large budgetary impact and minimal redistributional consequences. For consistency with these criteria, we argue that fiscal adjustments should operate on the spending side, rather than the revenue side, and that spending adjustments should affect the prices the government pays, instead of the quantities of goods and services it purchases. We discuss in detail how a system of this sort could be implemented.",the role of fiscal delegation in a monetary union: a survey of the political economy issues,2012,NA,"James Costain1, Beatriz de Blas21Bank of Spain, 2Autonomous University of Madrid",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Kennedy, Robbins and Delorme examine the importance of fiscal rules in determining budgetary outcomes. After briefly reviewing the rationale for rules, the paper compares the rules introduced in several countries at the national and subnational levels. It notes that while several countries have introduced restrictions on deficit, debt, tax and expenditure levels, some countries have focused their efforts on increasing transparency and accountability in the conduct of fiscal policy. Kennedy, Robbins and Delorme also evaluate the evidence about the impact of rules in terms of budgetary consolidation in the 1990s. The evidence indicates that both countries with rules and countries without rules implemented successful fiscal adjustments. From this, the authors conclude that rules may be helpful in achieving fiscal consolidation and may even be necessary in certain countries, but they are clearly not necessary in all countries. They also find that empirical studies of fiscal rules generally support this conclusion. However, determining the conditions under which fiscal rules are indeed necessary to ensure fiscal discipline remains an area for further research.",the role of fiscal rules in determining fiscal performance,2001,NA,"Suzanne Kennedy, Janine Robbins, François Delorme",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The main purposes of this paper are twofold: on the one hand, to determine if there are significant differences of regime on public expenditures, total revenues and tax revenues between the so-called PIGS and the remaining Eurozone member states and, on the other hand, to uncover possible explanations for the quite different situations in which these countries find themselves nowadays. This work focus on the effect of the cyclical state of the economy, captured by the unemployment rate, and on the two fiscal rules imposed by the Maastricht Treaty on the Eurozone member states. Based on the estimated results, which distinguish between PIGS and non-PIGS countries, we come to the conclusion that the anti-cyclical reaction with respect to the unemployment rate is much stronger among non-PIGS. We also find that fiscal rules have, in general, not been obeyed by the two groups of countries. Moreover PIGS, in spite of their economic frailties, have, instead, tried to emulate the fiscal behavior of their more prosperous Eurozone partners instead of implementing more rigorous policies.",the roots of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis: pigs vs non-pigs,2011,Panoeconomicus,"Abel L.

Nations that leave their blocs tend to vote with nearby blocs, rather than making large ideological shifts, and tend to return to their old blocs.

Considerable disagreement existed, however, with regards to their design features. Each institution promoted a distinct mode of indirect governance by ranking national fiscal councils depending on their adopted governance model (agent, trustee or orchestrator). This persuasion through entrepreneurial benchmarking constitutes an important mechanism by which member states were nudged to adopt a distinct fiscal council model.

"In a recent paper, we presented empirical evidence to show that strong budget institutions (rules and procedures of the budget process) were associated with more fiscal discipline even when the politics was unfavorable to such discipline. What then are the conditions under which budget institutions themselves may be improved (reformed)? We find, tentatively, that fiscal deficits do not focus the attention of policymakers on undertaking reforms. To the contrary, the larger is the deficit, the lower the likelihood of reforms. It is as if large deficits imply strong claims on the budget and, hence, create unwillingness to compromise and impose self-discipline. Countries will tend, therefore, to move to two outcomes: small fiscal deficits and good institutions or large deficits and weak institutions.

"The existence of a natural resource curse has been a longstanding theme in the economic
literature and in policy discussions. We propose an alternative mechanism and study its policy
implications. The mechanism is based on the interaction between two building blocks: specialization
in non-tradables and financial market imperfections. We show that if a country has a sufficiently
large non-resource tradable sector, relative prices can be stable, even when the resource sector
generates significant volatility in the demand for non-tradables. However, when the non-resource
tradable sector disappears, the economy becomes much more volatile, because shocks to the demand
for non-tradables - possibly associated with shocks to resource income - will not be accommodated
by movements in the allocation of labor but instead by expenditure-switching. This requires much
higher relative price movements. The presence of bankruptcy costs makes interest rates dependent
on relative price volatility. These two effects interact causing the economy to specialize inefficiently
away from non-resource tradables: the less it produces of them, the greater the volatility of relative
prices, the higher the interest rate the sector faces, causing it to shrink even further until it
disappears. At that point, the economy will face an even higher interest rate and a lower level of
capital and output in the non-tradable sector. An increase in resource income that leads to
specialization causes a large decline in welfare: thus the idea of the curse. Specialization is
determined by the expected size and volatility in resource income. The paper justifies stabilization
and savings policies as well as policies to make financial markets more efficient. However, we also
find some support for more interventionist second-best trade and financial","AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF

"The nine papers in this volume are a diverse set of quality contributions to the field in economics that is called political economy. It is important to understand that social scientists hold different interpretations of the term political economy. Most mainstream economists expect a paper in the field to use the same models as are used in neoclassical economics, be it micro or macro. The field of political economy is seen by most economists to be exclusively the purview of their field. However, the political system of a country determines the nature of its economics system. The economy feeds back to the political system but the rules of the game are determined by the political system.The study of politics is the hardest task in the social sciences. The political system defines the scope of the economics system while taking resources from the economy in order to run campaigns and produce the types of compromises that are required of a stable political system that allows economic agents to make sensible investments.

"We analyse whether there is a relationship between EU Commissioners’ national origin and political outcomes. For this purpose, we argue that examining the Commissioner for Agriculture allows the most precise empirical identiﬁcation: there is a speciﬁc budget for agriculture which accounts for the largest share of the overall EU budget and gives signiﬁcant leeway to the Commissioner. On average, providing the Commissioners is associated with increases in the share of the overall EU budget that is allocated to their country of origin of about one percentage point. This increase corresponds to half a billion Euro per year, a signiﬁcant change in particular for smaller member states. Alternative explanations are considered using country-speciﬁc time trends, examining pre- and post-treatment trends and modeling endogenous treatment-selection. There are no signiﬁcant differences in trend behavior between treated and non-treated countries both before and after providing the Commissioner.

"In this paper we study the relationship between legislature size and constituency size with respect to government spending. According to the theory, legislature size has an indefinite effect on government spending because logrolling and transaction costs may have cancelling effects. In turn, smaller constituency size is predicted to decrease government spending, because of homogeneity of interests and low monitoring costs. We use a panel of 23 OECD countries over the period 1975-1996 controlling for some institutional features that differ among these countries. We find that legislature size outperforms constituency size in explaining government spending.

"This dissertation explores the politics of fiscal decentralization in comparative perspective. Case studies of Argentina and Spain are used to provide insights into the way that the distribution of institutional and economic resources in multitiered polities shapes the extent to which the policy of transferring revenue and revenue authority to subnational governments can be exploited for political gain. This approach draws attention to the political conditions that inhibit the coordination of fiscal reform efforts between the different levels of government and perpetuate the financing of subnational spending with revenue collected by the national government. This political context undermines national fiscal adjustment efforts and leads to economic catastrophes such as those experienced in Argentina throughout the last two decades. Specifically, this study uses statistical analyses and empirical institutional theory to show how patterns of territorial representation and bargaining strategies hindered revenue decentralization in Argentina but advanced it in Spain.The research suggests, first, coalition-building goals drive national executives in Argentina to reach out legislators of the opposition by means of allocating larger shares of federal transfers to the provinces the latter belong to. However, all else equal, legislatively overrepresented, i.e. economically marginal and sparsely populated, provinces will be targeted first. Second, the increasing role of regionalist parties in Spanish national politics and their acceptance in joint-policy mechanisms tilts the allocation of chosen federal transfers slightly in favor of economically developed and densely populated autonomous communities, which are generally governed by regionalist forces. Third, whereas Argentine subnational interests are ""locked-in"" at the Senate level and intergovernmental negotiations are conducted bilaterally, open-ended institutional arrangements and a relatively impotent senate in Spain boosted the redressing of regional concerns through informal intergovernmental fora and increasing multilateral collaboration Fourth, such differences in patterns of institutional representation and bargaining strategies explain the paucity of fiscal decentralization in Argentina and its relative progress in Spain.",unraveling the politics of decentralization: argentina and spain in comparative perspective,2005,NA,Jorge P.

"One of the most robust empirical findings about direct democracy is that US states with the voter initiative tax and spend significantly less than states without the initiative, at least since the mid-1970s. The relationship between initiative status and fiscal policy has been interpreted as causal and as an indication that voters prefer smaller government than legislators. Yet, existing research has not explained exactly which elements of the public budget are cut in initiative states. This paper does so. First, I establish that the fiscal differential between initiative and non-initiative states is not due to smaller government budgets in general, but specifically due to lesser and more unequal education funding, primarily resulting from reductions in state aid to local school districts. Next, drawing upon a newly created data set that traces state education funding from the late 1800s to today, I explore the origins of these fiscal differentials. I find that some of the differences between would-be initiative and non-initiative states are evident even before the initiative existed. Others emerged only many decades after the initiative had been adopted. Tracing the causal pathway from the voter initiative to contemporary policy outcomes—if indeed there is one—is therefore a major challenge for scholarship in this area. I discuss implications of these results for the understanding of direct democracy and its effects on the relationship between voters and politicians.","voters, politicians, and schools: reassessing the fiscal effects of direct democracy",2013,NA,Christopher R.

This defines the set of utility allocations that can be achieved in a society subject to the constraints of tastes and technologies. Any allocation on the frontier cannot be Pareto dominated and hence would satisfy a rather minimal condition for it to be socially desirable.,welfare economics and public choice,2004,NA,Timothy Besley,Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article examines the political and economic determinants of the relative duration of fiscal consolidations in Europe. The study focuses on the fifteen Member States that formed the EU between 1960 and 2004, and applies survival analysis techniques to their fiscal data. We find evidence that the probability of ending a period of fiscal consolidation depends on the debt level, the magnitude of the adjustment, the relative contribution of spending cuts, and the degree of cabinet fragmentation. Most importantly we also find that under a stricter definition of fiscal consolidation, political variables, such as coalition size and election year, gain importance with respect to economic variables as predictors of the probability of ending an episode of fiscal consolidation. This relative importance of political variables weakened in the run-up to EMU, probably because countries had to consolidate irrespective of their political constraints.",what makes fiscal consolidations last? a survival analysis of budget cuts in europe (1960–2004),2008,Public Choice,"Reyes Maroto Illera1, Carlos Mulas-Granados21Charles III University of Madrid, 2Complutense University of Madrid",Microsoft Academic,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1215

"The budget process is increasingly considered key for reform efforts to improve fiscal outcomes. In this paper we embark on a political economy analysis of the budget process in Argentina, in the spirit of the IDB project “Political Institutions, Policymaking Processes and Policy Outcomes” in order to understand who determines budget outcomes in Argentina. In particular, we seek to characterize the institutional framework that regulates the budget preparation, approval, implementation and control. Furthermore, we identify which actors are involved both formally and informally in the process at each stage, and seek to understand their incentives and interactions. We find that the President has a de facto role that is much more powerful than what the laws and institutions of the budget process stipulate. However, the rigidity of the budget process, together with other constraints such as macroeconomic shocks, fiscal rules, agreements with International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and the influence of other actors such as governors, legislators and lobbies - have limited the ability of the Executive to substantially modify the budget process. Furthermore, compared with the period of high inflation of 1983-1991, in the past decade we have witnessed dramatic improvements in the institutionalization of the budget process, both in political and administrative terms. These reforms have accompanied a strong improvement in fiscal outcomes in the 1990s compared with the 1980s, and provided some of the tools necessary to limit the depth of the recent crisis and regain macroeconomic stability.",who decides on public expenditures?: a political economy analysis of the budget process: the case of argentina,2005,Public Economics,"Emmanuel Abuelafia1, Sergio Berensztein2, Miguel Braun1, Luciano Di Gresia31CIPPEC, 2Torcuato di Tella University, 3National University of La Plata",Microsoft Academic,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Preliminary analysis reveals only small or negligible differences in the way democracies and autocracies distribute electrification across their populations, especially to their poorest citizens.

"The goals pursued by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) require the collaboration of dozens of federal agencies and thousands of state and local entities. Intergovernmental funding within DHS has become one of the most politicized and criticized aspects of this process. This study analyzed the US Department of Homeland Security's state grant program from 2002 to 2007 to examine whether strong incentives to distribute these funds politically overrode the impetus to distribute them according to greatest risk or need. Using a random effects panel data model, several independent variables reflecting political and risk factors were regressed to examine the extent each of these factors affects the funding process. This paper further advances the research by explicitly comparing the relative importance of political versus risk factors over a 6 year time period with particular focus on whether allocations within Homeland Security's state grant program are primarily determined by political or objective criterion. The research found, that the political variables are more consistently significant predictors of allocations than the risk variables.

"This paper examines which economic, institutional and political characteristics of countries affect the likelihood that a numeral rule will be adopted as part of a fiscal strategy to limit the level of public debt. We estimate a panel binary response model over the period 1970-2012 for 110 countries, of which 58 opted to adopt such a rule. Our results suggest that the probability such a rule will be adopted is greater if a country has a high level of public debt, a relatively inflexible exchange rate regime, has already adopted inflation targeting, has deep credit markets, and if other countries already have adopted a debt rule. There are some differences in decision factors between high-income and lower-income countries, with the level of economic development and the openness of the economy playing opposite roles in each country group, and the impact of monetary unions on debt rule adoption being much stronger in the former group.

"Building on the literature on public finance, this article explores the consequences of political scale for government spending. The central argument is that the tendency for small political units to have big governments is not merely the result of economies of scale in the provision of public goods, but a reflection of the greater pressures for public spending faced by politicians in smaller and more homogeneous political units. The importance of such political pressures relative to other influences on spending is assessed on the basis of subnational data by comparing the relationship between size and spending under democracy and dictatorship. To the extent that government expansion is driven by citizen demands, the impact of size on spending may be expected to be more pronounced under democratic than authoritarian governance. Results from a time-series cross-sectional analysis of growth in government spending are consistent with this expectation. Government growth is shaped not only by the population size of political units but also by the interaction between regime and size. Analysis of spending patterns under democratic rule further indicates that size is an important determinant of spending even after controlling for variations in citizen preferences, political institutions, electoral competitiveness, and economic performance. The results have important theoretical implications for the study of fiscal policy and democratic governance around the world because they suggest that political scale conditions the linkages between citizens and the state, creating widely varying incentives for government growth across differently sized political units.",why do small states have big governments,2010,European Political Science Review,Karen L.

Indeed, in promoting both free trade and accountable government, the WTO reflects many of the insights that inform our own Madisonian Constitution. Professors McGinnis and Movsesian reject recent proposals to grant the WTO regulatory authority, endorsing instead the WTO's limited adjudicative power as the better means to resolve the difficult problem of covert protectionism. They develop a series of procedure-oriented tests that would permit WTO tribunals to invalidate covert protectionism without supplanting national judgments on labor, environmental, health, and safety policies. Finally, they demonstrate that the WTO's emerging approach to the problem of covert protectionism largely comports with the democracy-reinforcing jurisprudence they recommend, and they offer some suggestions for reforms that would help prevent the organization from going astray in the future.",the world trade constitution,2000,Harv.

"The existence of a natural resource curse has been a longstanding theme in the economic literature and in policy discussions. We propose an alternative mechanism and study its policy implications. The mechanism is based on the interaction between two building blocks: specialization in non-tradables and financial market imperfections. We show that if a country has a sufficiently large non-resource tradable sector, relative prices can be stable, even when the resource sector generates significant volatility in the demand for non-tradables. However, when the non-resource tradable sector disappears, the economy becomes much more volatile, because shocks to the demand for non-tradables - possibly associated with shocks to resource income - will not be accommodated by movements in the allocation of labor but instead by expenditure-switching. This requires much higher relative price movements. The presence of bankruptcy costs makes interest rates dependent on relative price volatility. These two effects interact causing the economy to specialize inefficiently away from non-resource tradables: the less it produces of them, the greater the volatility of relative prices, the higher the interest rate the sector faces, causing it to shrink even further until it disappears. At that point, the economy will face an even higher interest rate and a lower level of capital and output in the non-tradable sector. An increase in resource income that leads to specialization causes a large decline in welfare: thus the idea of the curse. Specialization is determined by the expected size and volatility in resource income. The paper justifies stabilization and savings policies as well as policies to make financial markets more efficient. However, we also find some support for more interventionist second-best trade and financial",an alternative interpretation of the'resource curse': theory and policy implications,2003,NA,"R Hausmann, R Rigobon",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

The German electoral system includes a mechanism which assigns whether legislators are elected under the ""first-past-the-post"" (FPTP), or the proportional representation (PR) electoral rule.

We find significant differences in committee membership, depending whether the legislator is elected though FPTP or PR. Legislators elected through FPTP system are members of committees that allows them to service their geographically based constituency. Legislators elected through PR are members of committees that service the party constituencies, which are not necessarily geographically based.","plurality rule, proportional representation, and the german bundestag: how incentives to pork-barrel differ across electoral systems",2002,American Journal of Political Science,"T Stratmann, M Baur ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"If different parties control the U.S. Congress and White House, the United States may maintain higher import protection than otherwise. This proposition follows from a distributive politics model in which Congress can choose to delegate trade policymaking to the President. When the congressional majority party faces a President of the other party, the former has an incentive to delegate but to constrain the President by requiring congressional approval of trade proposals by up-or-down vote. This constraint forces the President to provide higher protection in order to assemble a congressional majority. Evidence confirms that (1) the institutional constraints placed on the President's trade policymaking authority are strengthened in times of divided government and loosened under unified government and (2) U.S. trade policy was significantly more protectionist under divided than under unified government during the period 1949-90.

"The design of budget rules and institutions, long a neglected area in public finance and macroeconomics, has recently been thrust to center stage by the debate over a balanced budget amendment and other deficit-reduction measures in the United States.

It contrasts the `institutional irrelevance view,' which holds that budget rules can be circumvented by modifying accounting practices and changing the nominal timing or other classification of taxes and expenditures, with the `public choice view' in which fiscal institutions represent important constraints on the behavior of political actors. Several distinct strands of empirical evidence, from the U.S. federal experience with anti-deficit rules, from U.S. state experience with balanced budget rules, and from international comparisons of budget outcomes in nations with different fiscal institutions, suggest that fiscal institutions do matter. These results reject the institutional irrelevance view.

"Political economic theories, legal doctrine and political rhetoric frequently assume that overregulation is a pervasive problem requiring remedial measures. Despite the prevalence of these theories, Professor Buzbee demonstrates how a dynamic that he labels the ""regulatory commons"" problem can create predictable incentives for legislators or regulators to fail to address even broadly perceived social ills. The Article draws on and enriches the ""tragedy of the commons"" tale, with its usual focus on an underlying common pool resource and conflicts among users of that resource. Professor Buzbee shows how that literature's focus on the underlying resource and multiple resource users neglects incentives for inattention created by the existence of numerous potential regulators.

Where numerous regulators share potential jurisdiction over a regulatory opportunity, and there is a mismatch between those regulators' jurisdictions and the causes and effects of a harmful activity, a regulatory commons dynamic is created. The commons resource here is not the underlying threatened amenity, but the shared regulatory opportunity in a situation of jurisdictional mismatch. Where no regulator has primacy over such a social ill, those seeking a regulatory response will be uncertain where to turn, thereby fragmenting their demands and reducing each regulator's perception of a pressing social need. Potential regulators similarly will find ills encountering a regulatory commons dynamic to be unattractive opportunities for political investment and credit claiming. Regulators are unlikely to be blamed for a problematic status quo, will be unable to control other regulators, and if they choose to act may create ineffective regulation due to others' actions. Furthermore, drawing on public choice scholarship and behavioral law and economics, this Article shows how deviation from the status quo baseline will be especially disfavored in the setting of a dispersed social ills and fragmented regulatory frameworks. Professor Buzbee then reviews prominent overregulation theories, many drawn from public choice scholarship, and shows how such overregulation assumptions are reflected in contemporary administrative law jurisprudence. Propensities to ignore dispersed social ills created by the regulatory commons dynamic can be reconciled with overregulation theories. One can anticipate intermittent and sometimes stringent regulation, often created after events galvanize public perceptions of crisis. Stringent regulation, however, should not be mistaken for comprehensive regulation. The Article closes by discussing implications of the regulatory commons dynamic and offering means to surmount it.",recognizing the regulatory commons: a theory of regulatory gaps,2003,Iowa L.

"Local and regional governments account for an important share of total government spending and, given the decentralization trend in OECD nations, this is likely to increase. How should this spending be governed? This article argues that direct democracy is best suited to organize decision-making at the state and local level. To support this, we present the main theoretical arguments on why and how referenda and initiatives affect fiscal policy outcomes. The basic argument concerns voter control. Under representative democracy, citizens only have direct control at election time. With referenda and initiatives, citizens can selectively control their representatives on specific policies whenever they deviate sufficiently from citizens' preferences. As a result, fiscal policy outcomes are likely to more closely reflect voter preferences. We empirically test this on Swiss data since Switzerland provides a 'natural laboratory' for local governance. The governance structures of Swiss cantons and localities with respect to fiscal issues range from classic parliamentary democracy to pure direct democracy, and an important part of spending and taxation is controlled at these levels. Specifically, we estimate an econometric model of fiscal behaviour using data from 1986 to 1997 for the 26 Swiss cantons, and 1990 data on 134 local communities. It is shown that mandatory referenda on fiscal issues at both levels have a dampening effect on expenditure and revenue, and at the local level also on public debt. Combining this with existing empirical evidence leads to a relatively uncontested result, namely that elements of direct democracy are associated with sounder public finances, better economic performance and higher satisfaction of citizens.",the political economy of direct legislation: direct democracy and local decision–making,2001,Economic policy,"LP Feld, G Kirchgässner ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Abstract This paper analyzes the political determinants of the distribution of infrastructure expenditures by the Italian government to the country’s 92 provinces between 1953 and 1992. Extending implications of formal theories of legislative behavior to the context of open-list proportional representation, we examine whether individually powerful legislators and ruling political parties direct spending to core or marginal electoral districts, and the extent to which opposition parties share resources via a norm of universalism. We show that districts characterized by politically more powerful individual deputies from the governing parties received higher amounts of investments. We interpret this result as indicating that legislators with political resources sought to reward their core voters by investing in public works in their districts. The governing parties, by contrast, were not able to discipline their own members of parliament suciently to target the parties’ areas of core electoral strength. In Italy’s weak party system, the political influence of powerful individual legislators trumped the political imperatives of the ruling parties. Finally, we find no evidence that a norm of universalism operated to direct resources to areas where the main opposition party was strong.","pork‐barrel politics in postwar italy, 1953–94",2008,American Journal of Political Science,"MA Golden, L Picci ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Correcting the relative lack of attention to the supply side of trade policy, this article addresses how political institutions channel societal demands for protection. I hypothesize that strong presidents with significant legislative powers and strong party leaders-empowered through electoral rules that rein in the personal vote-can help overcome protectionist biases. These arguments compare with two institutional alternatives: first, that protectionism should decrease as electoral district size grows because elections become more proportional; and second, that the collective-action problems in fragmented party systems thwart trade reform. I evaluate these hypotheses empirically using pooled time-series-cross-sectional data involving 18 developing countries from 1971 to 1997. I find that delegation to presidents and party leaders is significantly related to trade liberalization, and some evidence suggests that the effective number of parties and the size of electoral districts may also influence levels of protectionism.

"Public choice theory has gained increasing popularity among legal scholarm Proponents maintain that, as a descriptive theory of legislation, public choice is uniquely
capable of explaining legislative behavior by reference to legislators' desires to maximize their chances of re-election Some advocates also maintain that this description,
when applied to the enactment ofparticular statutes, can provide a normative theory of
how judges ought to interpret those statutes. In this Article, Professor Rubin questions
the explanatory power of public choice theory and its ability to aid in the judicial construction of statute According to Professor Rubin, the value of public choice as a
descriptive theory ought to be assessed in terms of its explanatory scope and the plausibility of its assumptions. On this score, public choice fares no better, and possibly
worse, than an alternative theory of ""comprehensive rationality,"" which explains political behavior in terms of legislators' professed motivations, including their idealistic
and professional concern& Professor Rubin also argues that public choice cannot serve
as the basis for a normative theory of statutory construction because it is committed to
treating judges in the same manner as legislators--that is, as narrowly self-interested.
Thus, it cannot explain why judges ought to heed any particular theory of statutory
construction.",beyond public choice: comprehensive rationality in the writing and reading of statutes,1991,NYUL Rev.,EL Rubin ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

" The purpose of this Article is to analyze, using modern social
 choice theory, the problems of legislative protection of rights. In so
 doing, we ask the question, in what sense is majority rule ""self-
 policing""? Put another way, are violations of normative principles,
 such as the rights of minorities, self-correcting by virtue of the ma-
 jority rule and electoral processes? We show that the answer is no.
 Indeed, the modern theory of social choice and its specific applica-
 tions to majority rule show just the opposite. This theory yields a
 series of disturbing propositions for democratic theory. First, there
 is a fundamental and inescapable arbitrariness to majority rule.
 Second, majority rule processes are manipulable under certain cir-
 cumstances, namely when there is a small group controlling the
 agenda-the order and content of the alternatives that arise for a
 vote. These propositions imply that majority rule provides no in-
 herent protection for the rights of minorities.",constitutional regulation of legislative choice: the political consequences of judicial deference to legislatures,1988,Va. L.

"Although there has been extensive research on the economic functions of financial exchanges and the properties of prices determined on exchanges, there has been little research on their organization and governance. The heterogeneity of the suppliers of financial services who are members of financial exchanges explains salient features of exchange organization. When suppliers of financial services are heterogeneous, one expects to observe exchanges organized as not‐for‐profit firms, especially if an exchange can enforce collusive agreements. Moreover, heterogeneity can lead to conflicts between members over rents, which necessitates the creation of formal governance mechanisms. Finally, if exchanges exercise market power or are protected from competitive entry (as is plausible), exchanges may adopt inefficient rules; the efficiency of exchange rules depends on the degree of member heterogeneity, the distributive consequences of these rules, and the ability of exchange governance structures to enforce wealth‐enhancing bargains among members with disparate interests.",a theory of financial exchange organization,2000,The Journal of Law and Economics,C Pirrong ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A reduced form equation system is used to analyze the influence of economic, political, and institutional influences on the budgetary priorities of the executive branch and Congress during fiscal 1955-81. Three related issues are considered: the extent to which political and macroeconomic factors affect priorities; the degree of interdependence among the components of the federal budget and between spending and revenues; and differences between the executive branch and Congress with respect to these issues. Both types of interdependence are present within both executive branch and congressional budgeting, although this interdependence is stronger within the executive branch. The influence of economic conditions on budgetary outcomes is strong but varies considerably across spending categories. There is no evidence of a political business cycle. Political variables exert a modest influence on the budgetary outcomes examined; differences between Democratic and Republican budgetary policies, as well as differences in the budgetary priorities of different presidential administrations, are small by comparison with the differences between executive and congressional policies.","influences on executive and congressional budgetary priorities, 1955–1981",1987,American Political Science Review,"MS Kamlet, DC Mowery ",Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1258
"""Technological optimism"" is a term of art, an article of faith, and a theory of politics. It is a view that pervades modem attitudes, yet gets little explicit attention. For a brief period the situation was otherwise. In the early 1970s, the optimistic outlook figured prominently in an important debate about nothing less than the future of the world. Technological optimism won. The outcome was unsurprising, given the nature of the argument. On one side of the debate was a group of self-proclaimed Malthusians who foresaw an impending period of stark scarcity unless relatively drastic remedial steps were quickly taken; on the other side were the technological optimists, whose message, essentially, was not to worry--at least not too much. The two sides moved quickly to joinder on an issue that neither could carry. The debate, in other words, reached a dead-end; it came down to believing whatever one wished. Most people wish to be optimistic. This is why the optimists triumphed. It is also why, today, critical discussion of the optimistic viewpoint is largely passé. The literature on the subject is more or less closed. Not many people know very much about it, lawyers in particular. The exception might be those who work and teach in fields like environmental law and natural resources, where technological optimism has a special relevance and a notable dominance. Our aim in this essay is to reopen the old debate and move it to new ground. Resolution, on the assumption it could ever be within our capacities, is for the present not on our agenda. We hope for now only to reveal and explore the assumptions or premises of the optimistic viewpoint, and to explain why they trouble us. Placed in its largest setting, our argument is indeed about the future of the world--a sure way to lose an audience--but we are content merely to consider its implications for technology at a time of continuing enthusiasm for technological solutions, and, briefly, its implications for American politics at a time of growing concern about democracy's capacity to cope with modern-day problems. We proceed from where we began, by considering technological optimism as a term of art, as an article of faith, and especially as a theory of politics.",the un-easy case for technological optimism,1985,Mich.

"Budgeting can be understood as a common resource pool problem where spending agencies have incentives to encourage excessive levels of current spending and reduce budget surplus or create budget deficits. The political leadership is assumed to have an important role in keeping fiscal control and resisting the high‐demanders’ pressure for increased spending. Three factors of relevance for their success are investigated: political characteristics (political colour and political strength, the strength of relevant interest groups) and two institutional characteristics– committee structure and budgeting procedures. The analyses are based on panel data from up to 434 Norwegian municipalities in the period from 1991 to 1998. The results support the hypothesis that strong political leadership improves fiscal performance. The effect of interest groups is to a high degree community‐specific. However, an increased share of elderly reduces fiscal surplus. Differences in budgetary procedures do not seem to affect fiscal performance. A strong committee structure seems, on the other hand, to result in better fiscal performance than a weaker one.","political characteristics, institutional procedures and fiscal performance: panel data analyses of norwegian local governments, 1991–1998",2005,European Journal of Political Research,"TP Hagen, SI Vabo ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Using new historical data from Swiss cantons, we estimate the effect of direct democracy on government spending. We use fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity and new instruments to address potential endogeneity concerns.

The instrumental variable estimates show that a mandatory budget referendum reduces canton expenditures by 12%. Lowering signature requirements for the voter initiative by 1% reduces canton spending by 0.6%. We find little evidence that direct democracy at the canton level results in higher local spending or decentralisation.","does direct democracy reduce the size of government? new evidence from historical data, 1890–2000",2011,The Economic Journal,"P Funk, C Gathmann ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In previous studies of distributive politics scholars have investigated legislative influence without accounting for the policies' independent merits. As a result, they have failed to include a plausible explanation of the counterfactual (i.e., which projects would have been funded in the absence of congressional committee influence), which has led to invalid inferences regarding legislative influence. The model of distributive politics is reformulated to account for an assumed efficient and/or equitable project allocation in the absence of legislative influence. Using data from proposed Army Corps of Engineers' projects and the funding recommendations of three institutions, the findings indicate that pork barrel politics indeed exists and imposes significant efficiency costs but that both equity and economic efficiency play prominent roles in the decision-making process as well. Cost-benefit analysis is seen to play a constructive role by improving the efficiency of project choice; and the corps's cost-benefit analysis guidelines are beneficial from the agency's organizational perspective, as well.",the political economy of pork: project selection at the us army corps of engineers,1991,American Political Science Review,JA Hird ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

" Public finance is one of the oldest branches of economics. For centuries
 economic policy consisted of little else. But in the twentieth century the range
 of issues with which tax policy is concerned has widened greatly. In Victorian
 - or frontier - days the primary function of government was the provision of
 public goods - defence, police, a system of contract law and a mechanism for
 its enforcement. The task of tax policy was to obtain funds for these purposes
 with the minimum of fuss- and expenditure. But in modern states public goods
 are a minor part of overall state activity (Table I). Much of government
 expenditure is devoted to the provision to users, at prices well below cost, of
 private goods such as health and education. Income maintenance is another
 principal function. Together these categories total more than half of public
 spending for all the countries of Table i. The essential nature of fiscal activity
 now is either to raise taxes on some commodities to permit subsidies on others,
 or to impose taxes on some individuals to make grants to others. The link
 between tax and spending is now close and symmetric. But this symmetry is
 rarely reflected in the theory, or the practice, of tax policy",tax policy: a survey,1990,The Economic Journal,JA Kay ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

" The subgovernment model of policy making has been in popular
 usage for more than twenty years and has been relied upon to explain a great deal
 of policy output. 1 Briefly, the theory holds that tripartite alliances formed between
 congressional committees or subcommittees, interest groups, and government agen-
 cies are all concerned with the same substantive policy. Their relationship is mutu-
 ally advantageous; through the expenditure of government funds for their common
 policy interests the legislator gains political support; the government agency in-
 creases its budget, power, and personnel base; and the interest groups receive govern-
 ment largess. These three-sided alliances are also known as iron triangles, policy
 whirlpools, cozy little triangles, and subsystems.

"The volume of theoretical literature seeking to explain public-debt accumulation has exploded in recent years as debt crises have emerged in many nations.

"A common political claim is that decentralized governments undermine policy-makers' ability to resist fiscal imbalance. This paper examines how fiscal centralization influences the likelihood of a successful fiscal adjustment. Using a panel of Swiss cantons from 1981 to 2001, we empirically investigate the determinants of successful long-lasting deficit reductions. Contrary to some results in the literature, we find that fiscal centralization significantly decreases the probability of a successful fiscal consolidation when the contravening effects of competitive and cooperative federalism are disentangled. The results also point to an important role of the economic environment, in particular the size of the primary balance in the years before the consolidation, in determining whether adjustment policy is successful.",are fiscal adjustments less successful in decentralized governments?,2009,European Journal of Political Economy,"CA Schaltegger, LP Feld ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the numerical fiscal rules in force in the 25 countries of the European Union, examines the reasons for the growing appetite for such rules, and assesses whether they have an influence on budgetary developments. The analysis is based on a new dataset constructed from questionnaires submitted to experts in finance ministries of EU countries which report a large amount of information on the numerical fiscal rules in force in the EU countries over the 1990–2005 period. The chapter shows that the number of fiscal rules in force in the EU countries has increased in the past decades. The introduction of the Maastricht Treaty and of the SGP seem to have been catalysts for the introduction of fiscal rules. The analysis, based on the estimation of augmented fiscal reaction functions, confirms the existence of a relation between numerical fiscal rules and budgetary developments. The results show that some dimensions matter particularly for the capacity of fiscal rules to influence fiscal policy.

"Recent research on federations, particularly in the developing world, emphasizes the importance of hard budget constraints and a strong central government to attenuate intergovernmental economic conflicts. Such research fails on two counts. First, it does not explain how hard budget constraints emerge or become self-enforcing. Second, it does not take into account the insight of the market-preserving federalism literature that central governments strong enough to impose restraint on regions are likely too powerful to be checked in a manner consistent with the longterm health of markets. Unfortunately, the market-preserving federalism literature itself provides little insight into how to move from a market-distorting to a market-preserving equilibrium. This article answers these theoretical shortcomings with reference to the evolution of political competition at the regional level and the representation of those regions at the national level. More specifically, whereas regional competition determines the subnational demand for soft budget constraints, the coalition of those regions at the national level determines the likelihood of their provision. Empirically, the research relies on a case study of the state debt crisis of the 1840s when the United States made a definitive movement toward market-preserving federalism.","bailouts, budget constraints, and leviathans: comparative federalism and lessons from the early united states",2003,Comparative Political Studies,E Wibbels ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Reforming budgetary institutions for effective government is a critical task for emerging economies. Strengthening the role of parliament in the budget process is an integral part of the restoration of democracy throughout Latin America, which requires a re-equilibration of executive and legislative prerogatives in public policy. The role of legislatures in public budgeting and public finance management has nevertheless been largely overlooked in the first stage of economic reform. This is starting to change, as the contribution of legislatures to the budgetary process is currently being re-evaluated, both in developed and, more recently, in developing countries.1 It is increasingly being recognised that parliaments have a critical role to play to strengthen economic governance, improve transparency in public finances and ensure government accountability. Enhancing legislative scrutiny of the budget and oversight of its execution is increasingly considered as a means to strengthen government accountability and curb corruption (OECD, 2002; G8, 2003).2 The international financial institutions are particularly keen to promote greater transparency in public finance management and to improve governmental financial information systems in emerging economies.",legislatures and budget oversight in latin america,2005,OECD Journal on Budgeting,C Santiso ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"A Final Word
In pointing out that government needed to be a smart buyer for contracting to
work well, Kettl (l993: 2ll) made an appeal for government to make an “investment in
smart buying.” The reinventing government movement of the l990’s heeded that appeal
for the front end of the procurement process – establishing requirements, structuring the
overall business arrangement, and selecting the right suppliers. It paid considerably less
attention to the contract administration process following contract award. The challenges
procurement reinventors of the l990’s faced were in the first instance institutional design
challenges involving the proper role for rules and discretion. By contrast, the challenges
of reinventing contract administration are predominantly challenges of human resources
management -- of people and job design. Given a growing concern about government’s
human capital crisis, the beginning of the new millennium represents an opportunity to
address this very important unfinished business",remaking the federal procurement,2001,Pub. Cont.

"Theories of tort liability generally fall within two broad camps: the instrumentalists claim that tort liability promotes efficient investments in safety by cutting into the revenues of those who under-invest in safety; and the advocates of corrective justice claim that tort liability embodies a moral obligation of culpable parties to bear losses for which they are fairly considered responsible. Neither theory offers much support for government tort liability. Unlike private tortfeasors, the government's objective is not profit maximization; it responds to political and not market discipline. Thus, the instrumental justification for tort liability is wanting in the public sector. As for corrective justice, the government passes its legal costs along to the taxpayers, who bear little if any culpability for the underlying tortious conduct. Thus, corrective justice also supplies little support for public-sector tort liability. Indeed, there is an emerging consensus among legal scholars that government tort liability lacks a coherent justification.

In this article, I endeavor to show that the emerging consensus is wrong. To do so, I anchor the justification for government tort liability in a theory of political behavior. I look to politics because the government responds primarily to political costs and benefits, whereas private tortfeasors respond primarily to economic rewards or punishment. In my view, government tort liability exacts a political price by diverting the funds used to pay judgments and other litigation costs from what elected officials regard as the politically optimal use of those funds. Therefore, government liability creates a political incentive to invest in loss prevention in order to maximize political control over public resources. This theory, however, does not argue for unlimited government liability; to the contrary, it also provides a justification for many of the immunities that limit government liability.","a theory of governmental damages liability: torts, constitutional torts, and takings",2006,U.

The prediction drawn from this analysis, that the item veto is likely to

legislative policy than it is power to curtail unwanted pork barrel appropriations, is supported by the history of both presidential impoundments

"Introduction: A fundamental characteristic of public finances is that they involve spending
decisions over other people’s money. Above the level of local administrations,
governments do not, or only to a very limited extent, act like businesses that charge
customers fees for particular activities. Instead, those who benefit from a particular
program of public policy are generally not the same as those who pay for it. This
incongruence moves distributional issues, i.e., the question of who pays and who
benefits, to the center of decision making in public finances.
Distributional conflicts have received much attention in efforts to explain the
high and rising levels of public debts and deficits observed since the early 1970s in
many countries around the world. Figure 1 illustrates these trends for various
countries. For a number of reasons, these developments are difficult to explain on
the basis of conventional economics.
According to Keynesian economics, fiscal policy is an important tool to control
the level of aggregate demand in the economy. Governments should run deficits in
times of recessions and surpluses in times of prosperity to stabilize the economy.
The incipient deficits in the oil-crisis of the 1970s fit this prescription, but their
persistence does not. Neo-classical economics, in contrast denies the stabilizing
potential of fiscal policy. According to this theory, however, taxes cause distortions in
the labor market, and the welfare costs of these distortions increase when tax rates
are changes frequently. Governments faced with an unavoidable, yet temporary rise
in spending, e.g., the response to a natural disaster or war, should, therefore,
engage in tax smoothing, i.e., they should raise tax rates only by a small amount and
run deficits until the need for extraordinary spending has disappeared. These
governments would then run surpluses in normal times to repay their debts (Barro,
1979). Again, the persistence of the observed deficits does not fit this prescription,
nor does the observation of large deficits in peace-times bode well with this view that
tax-smoothing should be applied in times of national emergencies.
One might argue that the increase in government debt during the 1970s was a
response to low real interest rates, hence a low cost of borrowing. But the extent to
which governments base their borrowing decisions on the level of real interest rates 
2
in practice is much in doubt. Furthermore, the argument does not fit the 1980s and
1990s, when real interest rates were much higher than in the 1970s. Finally, as
Figure 1 shows, there is a large degree of variation in the fiscal performance across
countries with relatively similar economic structures and environments; a variety that
the conventional arguments cannot explain.
The failure of conventional economics to explain these observations has
sparked interest in explanations of a political-economy nature focusing on
distributional conflicts. Key questions here are (1) can we explain large public deficits
by political factors, and (2) can we explain differences in the fiscal performance of
different governments by differences in the institutions governing their fiscal policies.
Recent literature has developed positive answers to both questions. After shortly
reviewing the arguments under the first question, this paper will focus on the second
one. The main message is that institutions shaping the budget process of a country
are an important factor in determining that countrys level of public deficits and
debts. The implication is that institutional reform of the budget process provides
important protection against large deficits and debts.
A number of recent examples highlight the relevance of and public interest in
the budget process. In the US, much of the political efforts to reduce the federal
deficit focused on institutional design: the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act which
imposed deficit targets on the federal budget, the Budget Enforcement Act which
protects the budget agreements between the President and Congress against
subsequent amendment, and, most recently, the strife for a Balanced Budget
Amendment. In Europe, compliance with the fiscal norms of the Maastricht Treaty
became a precondition for entering the European Monetary Union; national
differences in the translation of these norms into the domestic budgeting institutions
of the member states explain much of the differences in the success of reaching the
norms.

"We study the impact of expenditure rules on the propensity for governments to deviate from their expenditure plans in response to surprising cyclical developments. Theoretical considerations suggest that due to political fragmentation in the budgetary process expenditure policy might be prone to a procyclical bias. However, this tendency may be mitigated by strictly enforced expenditure rules. These hypotheses are tested against data from a panel of EU Member States. Our key findings are that (1) deviations between actual and planned government expenditure tend to be positively related to output gap surprises, and (2) expenditure rules reduce this procyclical bias. These results are particularly pronounced when the analysis is confined to spending items with a high degree of budgetary flexibility.",the impact of expenditure rules on budgetary discipline over the cycle,2012,Applied Economics,"F Holm-Hadulla  S Hauptmeier, P Rother ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper takes a fresh look at the trade-off between centralized and decentralized provision of local public goods. The point of departure is to model a centralized system as one in which public spending is financed by general taxation, but districts can receive different levels of local public goods. In a world of benevolent governments, the disadvantages of centralization stressed in the existing literature disappear, suggesting that the case for decentralization must be driven by political economy considerations. Our political economy analysis assumes that under decentralization public goods are selected by locally elected representatives, while under a centralized system policy choices are determined by a legislature consisting of elected representatives from each district. We then study the role of taste heterogeneity, spillovers and legislative behavior in determining the case for centralization.",centralized versus decentralized provision of local public goods: a political economy anaysis,1999,NA,"TJ Besley, S Coate",Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1293
"In the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (“RTAA”), Congress delegated its constitutionally granted power to set tariffs to the President. Trade agreements negotiated under the RTAA required no ex post congressional approval. Instead, the broad authority conferred upon the President was subject to congressional renewal every three years. Tariff reductions also were no longer made unilaterally via omnibus tariff legislation, but rather bilaterally via trade agreements and in exchange for comparable tariff reductions from foreign trading partners. The RTAA dramatically altered the governance structure that had controlled U.S. trade policymaking for over a century, laying a new institutional foundation that made U.S. postwar participation in, and leadership of, global trade liberalization and expansion possible. Indeed, the RTAA is arguably the most important piece of trade legislation of this century. It also is an unusual case of congressional delegation of policymaking authority to the President. Representative Hamilton Fish (R-N.Y.) called the RTAA “a betrayal of our representative form of government [that] amounts to an open admission by Congress that … it is now incompetent and unfit to legislate properly, intelligently and in the public interest.” The press described the RTAA as a “radical departure in commercial policy.” What accounts for this extraordinary delegation, especially by a legislative body better known for guarding its power than for giving it away?",the institutional foundation of us trade policy: revisiting explanations for the 1934 reciprocal trade agreements act,2000,Journal of Policy History,KE Schnietz ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In any society characterized by diversity and specialization, each citizen - the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker - is a special interest on some dimensions of public policy and a member of the general public on many other dimensions. Each citizen enjoys being at the receiving end of special interest handouts even at the expense of inefficiencies imposed on general public. But relative to the status quo involving inefficient redistribution on most dimensions of public policy, including many dimensions on which the citizen is a member of the general public, the vast majority of citizens would surely be better off if the government did not cater to special interests at all. With this common interest in place, why do democratic societies have such a hard time ridding themselves of special interest politics?

This article argues that the driving force underlying special interest politics is an information asymmetry: each citizen has a precise idea about the special interest handouts she is receiving and a vague idea about the price she is paying, as a member of the general public, for inefficient redistribution. I explain why special interest politics are ultimately impervious to reform (though we can tame them at the margin); I examine the trade-offs inherent in reform efforts (what it costs to tame them); and I spell out why special interest politics can be a Good Thing (why we should not tame them all the way even if we could)",representative government and special interest politics: (we have met the enemy and he is us),2003,Journal of Theoretical Politics,S Lohmann ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

It is well known that the fiscal performance of a country is actually determined by the interaction of may fiscal authorities within the public sector. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple model that adopts a game-theoretic point of view to investigate the consequences of different modes of interaction between federal and provincial jurisdictions for the determination of the overall public sector expenditures and taxes. We motivate the theoretical exercises presenting evidence regarding the fiscal performance of Argentina in 1970-1987 where an ill-designed system of intergovernmental grants has been associated with increasing provincial government deficits and of public sector expenditures.,intergovernmental transfers and public sector expenditures: a game-theoretic approach,1994,Estudios de Economia,P Sanguinetti ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In a recent article (and new book), Louis Kaplow and Steven Shavell argue that analysts of legal policy should rely exclusively on welfare economics in making decisions, and give no independent weight to fairness, justice, or several other such noneconomic considerations they treat as roughly synonymous. The authors say that fairness is worth worrying about to the extent that people have a taste for it, since in that case a policy that is fairer makes them better off by their own lights. But this exception does not make arguments about fairness as such relevant to legal policy; rather, it calls for purely empirical demonstrations, perhaps through surveys of public opinion, that a policy will upset people because it will offend their taste for fairness.

This essay raises a series of objections to Kaplow and Shavell's arguments. First, their acknowledgement that policies should take fairness into account if people have a taste for it has more implications than they recognize. It implies as well that if people have a taste for officials who take arguments about fairness seriously, then they should have officials who pay attention to those arguments (and not just to survey data) in making policy. In principle, the authors are open to the counting of any preferences, presumably including these; in practice, the extent of anyone's taste for fairness, presumably including their taste for officials who worry about fairness, is treated as an empirical question on which convincing data evidently will be hard to obtain. This puts appeals to such tastes at an unwarranted practical disadvantage, and overlooks the role of politics as a register of tastes for various notions of fairness.

Second, economics does not provide answers in situations where the contested issue is how much certain goods should be valued - what should count as a cost and as a benefit, and in what proportions. This becomes important when, as is common, a question of legal policy arises in an institutional setting where market measures of value are unavailable and direct empirical testing of people's tastes for fairness in various senses is infeasible and perhaps undesired by (distasteful to) the people themselves. Third, even if our ideas about the fairness of a decision express beliefs or intuitions about the costs and benefits at stake in it, this does not necessarily make cost-benefit analysis a superior procedure for decision than an appeal to fairness. It may be that beliefs about fairness capture costs and benefits in a way different from, and preferable to, the way they are likely to be captured in an economic analysis.",the taste for fairness,2002,Colum.

"How do we know whether a country suffers from vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI)? What should be done about it?

While the latter clearly is a problem of political negotiations, our focus is on the former, that is, conceptual clarity, which precedes meaningful negotiations. Thus, the paper aims to clarify the multiple usages of the symbolically loaded terms VFI and VFG (vertical fiscal gap) by critically engaging the fundamental assumptions and premises underlying these ostensibly similar notions. It proposes an alternative conceptual framework and introduces the concepts of vertical fiscal asymmetry (VFA) and vertical fiscal difference (VFD) that have the potential to better structure public debate on issues of vertical fiscal relations and stimulate a sensible appreciation of the problem and possible remedies",beyond gaps and imbalances: re‐structuring the debate on intergovernmental fiscal relations,2012,Public Administration,CK Sharma ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This study shows why the conventional wisdom that cities with ward elections will spend more than cities with at-large elections is too simple and explains why the empirical findings have been so mixed. Ward vs. at-large elections will only affect the policy choices of city councils when the policy choice is one that is decided by the median legislator. When the policy is one that is decided by the rule of universalism, the relevant institutional determinant of choice is the number of legislators, and not whether they are elected at-large or by wards. Universalism is politically rational for divisible policies that all constituents deisre (“pork”); the majority rule equilibrium (at the median) is more rational for divisible policies that are generally desired, but only when they are not located too close to any one constituent's home (“LULUs”). The expectation then is that larger city councils will provide more parks than smaller ones, and that election by wards or at-large will be irrelevant for these policy choices. By contrast, community centers and libraries are thought to be generally desireable, but not when they are in one's backyard. The size of the council is not predicted to be relevant for these decisions, but councils elected by wards are more likely to have a median legislator who represents geographically concentrated constituents, such as the minority poor; their preferences will have a bigger impact on councils elected by wards than on councils elected at large. Data from a sample of council-manager cities with weak mayors who have no veto uphold these hypotheses.","rethinking ward and at-large elections in cities: total spending, the number of locations of selected city services, and policy types",1996,Public Choice,"LI Langbein, P Crewson, CN Brasher ",Google Scholar,Third,The variables in the paper did not conform with the meta regression models we applied.,1309
"We analyse the deficits of the German Lander (regional states) for the period 1960 to 2005 and test a number of hypotheses derived from the literature on the political economy of public deficits. We find evidence for the weak government hypothesis, that is, coalition governments issue significantly more debt than single party governments - a result that is typically explained by the common pool problem. As our data suggest, this result crucially hinges on the position or strength of the finance minister within coalition governments. We find that coalition governments with a strong finance minister are - in terms of borrowing - not significantly different from single party governments. In addition, we find (weak) evidence for an opportunistic political business cycle. As borrowing is significantly lower in pre-election years it appears that German voters favour fiscal discipline. There is no evidence for partisan behaviour, so party ideology seems to play a negligible role.",the political economy of the german laender deficits,2005,NA,"B Jochimsen, R Nuscheler",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This manuscript empirically assesses the effects of political institutions on economic growth. It analyzes how political institutions affect economic growth in different stages of democratization and economic development by means of dynamic panel estimation with interaction terms. The new empirical results obtained show that political institutions work as a substitute for democracy promoting economic growth. In other words, political institutions are important for increasing economic growth, mainly when democracy is not consolidated. Moreover, political institutions are extremely relevant to economic outcomes in periods of transition to democracy and in poor countries with high ethnical fractionalization.",political institutions as substitute for democracy: a political economy analysis of economic growth,2009,NA,"C Pereira, VK Teles",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"We present an argument from micro-economic foundations suggesting that the federal Alternative Minimum Tax has potentially salutary – and heretofore unrecognized – effects that counteract pathologies of state budgets over the business cycle. AMT liability increases with income, and acts to eliminate federal tax subsidies for state revenue-raising. Thus, as a states’ income grow and the AMT hits more state residents, state spending becomes more expensive in flush times as the federal tax subsidy for state and local taxes is reduced. Conversely, when state fiscal health deteriorates, the federal tax subsidy grows as fewer state residents fall under the AMT, boosting taxpayer support for state spending. This stabilizing mechanism has the potential to overcome problems state politicians face committing to saving during boom times and spending during bust times.

We present empirical evidence suggesting that the AMT does indeed provide some degree of fiscal stabilization in accordance with micro-theory. We also provide policy suggestions regarding how the AMT could be modified to leverage this stabilization effect.",recessions and the social safety net: the alternative minimum tax as a countercyclical fiscal stabilizer,2010,Stan.

The main types of models examined are a permanent income model, electoral cycle models, and stabilization policy models.

The paper concludes that government expenditure grows in proportion to national income because politicians find it convenient to plan that way; electoral-cyclical factors are relatively unimportant in determining public expenditure; there appears to be a limited role for public expenditure in economic stabilization policy; in a comparative context institutions of expenditure control are important in determining relative rates of growth of public sector consumption expenditure.","electoral cycles, budget controls and public expenditure*",1981,Journal of Public Policy,"J Alt, KA Chrystal ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This forward focuses on economic and political aspects of local
land use controls. Our purpose is to bring the logic of economic markets and the economic interpretation of property right systems to bear
on the problem of land use. With a grounding in the mechanisms
that motivate uncoordinated economic decisionmakers, we may understand something about the pattern and consequences of location
decisions, particularly as they relate to problems of incompatible uses
of adjacent property. This serves to illucidate the mechanics of the
price system and the signals which confront decisionmakers. We
then develop the rationale for land use regulation concerning potential problems of incompatible uses. We argue that there is no justification for comprehensive land use control. This is followed by a discussion of the political consequences of land use regulation and
the biases induced by the political system. Our point is that land use
control, like many other forms of regulation with laudable goals, affords politicians opportunities to pursue substantially different purposes from the stated rationale for controls. We argue that land use
controls are more likely to serve political ends than to solve problems
that occur through uncoordinated decisions over land use.",the political economy of land use regulation,1982,Urb. L.

" The phenomenal growth in our public
 deficits over the past twenty years is a matter
 of public and professional concern (see Sym-
 posium, 1989). While this concern may in-
 deed be well founded (particularly given cur-
 rent deficit levels), public deficits are not
 always bad. Certainly in times of deep reces-
 sions, short-term deficit financing can stim-
 ulate aggregate demand, increase national
 income, and reduce unemployment in a
 Keynesian fashion (see Richard Startz, 1989).
 Second, long-term deficit financing may be
 needed to sustain a long-term path of opti-
 mal consumption (see Peter Diamond, 1965).
 Third, public deficits (including pay-as-you-
 go Social Security) can offer welfare gains
 for significant subsets of consumers who
 have been liquidity constrained (R. Glenn
 Hubbard and Kenneth Judd, 1986), who have
 been unable to purchase indexed private an-
 nuities (Alan Blinder, 1988), or who have
 been unable to sufficiently diversify their
 investment portfolios away from human cap-
 ital (Robert Merton, 1983).
 Finally, Robert Barro (1979) has argued
 that public deficits may be an important
 policy instrument to insure intertemporal
 welfare maximization when public expen-
 ditures are stochastic and public taxes are
 economically inefficient; taxes can be
 ""smoothed"" to reduce the lifetime excess
 burden of public financing. The concern to-
 day is not that we have deficits, but rather
 that we may be overdoing a good thing. If

"This paper studies the effects of term duration on legislative behavior using field experiments that occur in the Arkansas, Illinois, and Texas Senates in the United States. After mandatory changes in senate district boundaries, state senators are randomly assigned to serve either two-year or four-year terms, providing a rare opportunity to study legislative behavior experimentally. Despite important differences across states, when considered together, the results show that senators serving two years abstain more often, introduce fewer bills, and do not seem to be more responsive to their constituents than senators serving four years. In addition, senators serving shorter terms raise and spend significantly more money, although in those states where funds can be raised continuously during the legislative term, the differences arise only when the election is imminent.",drawing your senator from a jar: term length and legislative behavior,2016,Political Science Research and Methods,R Titiunik ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article develops a formal model of the centralization of natural resource regulation, and applies that model to explain selected episodes in the history of American natural resource regulation and to critique the Supreme Court's constitutional federalism doctrine. On this model, political pressure for centralized control over the development of public natural resources arises as a virtually inevitable consequence of economic development and geographic market integration. The model reveals the fundamental normative ambiguity of centralized controls over natural resource development. On the one hand, centralized regulation of natural resource development responds to a fundamental inefficiency that arises because local jurisdictions are unable to internalize the full, global value of preserving open access resources. From a distributional point of view, however, such centralized controls may have the effect of penalizing late-developing jurisdictions simply for being latecomers to the interjurisdictional development game. Moreover, unless one believes that the political bargaining process is always efficient, centralized resource development controls may simply represent inefficient rent-seeking by older, more heavily developed jurisdictions. These general normative implications of the model have direct application to the Supreme Court's Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. The Court has consistently misunderstood state schemes that give state residents discriminatory access to state natural resources as economic protectionism when, as the analysis here shows, they may be necessary to create political support for the conservation of state natural resources. In addition to this normative analysis, the article tests the model's predictions about when and why regulatory centralization has occurred against both qualitative historical data and more quantitative contemporary data on the federal Endangered Species Act. Original and previously unavailable data are presented here which show radical disparities across states in the actual applicability of the Endangered Species Act's takings prohibition, and which show also that Congressional positions on the ESA are influenced as much or more by whether the ESA actually applies to limit land development in a state or district than by political party affiliation.",the tragedy of centralization: the political economics of american natural resource federalism,2003,U.

"This Article critiques the prevailing justification for subsidies for the charitable sector, and suggests a new alternative. According to contemporary accounts, charity corrects the failure of the private market to provide public goods, and further corrects the failure of government to provide goods other than those demanded by the median voter.

However, the claim that government can meet the needs only of a single “median voter” neglects both federalism and public choice theory. Citizens dissatisfied with the services of one government can move to or even create another. Alternatively, they may use the threat of exit to lobby for local change. Subsidies for charity inefficiently distort the operation of these markets for legal rules.

Nonetheless, there remains a strong case for subsidizing charity, albeit on grounds new to the literature. Charity serves as gap-filler when federalism mechanisms break down. For example, frictions on exit produce too little jurisdictional competition, and excessively easy exit produces too much competition - a race to the bottom. At the same time, competition from government constrains inefficient charities. Thus, charity and government each perform best as complements to the other.

Finally, this Article sketches the normative legal consequences of these claims. Most significantly, I respond to the claims by Malani and Posner that for-profit charity would be superior to current arrangements. That suggestion would fatally weaken competition between charity and government, defeating the only persuasive purpose for charitable subsidies.",the role of charity in a federal system,2011,Wm. & maRy L.

"In the past thirty years, local governments in most European countries have been granted at least limited access to borrowing. The rules in force include limitations on the amount of borrowing and/or debt service, restrictions on the purpose of debt and on borrowing from foreign institutions and/or from the central bank. The description of these rules and sanctions constitute the thrust of several academic studies on local borrowing and debt. What are the ingredients that make it work efficiently? Fiscal discipline is not a simple question of having or not rules limiting deficits and debt. From ""soft"" to ""hard"" budget constraints, there are various degrees of severity. Dafflon (1995, 1996) proposed a catalogue of ten key issues that might help local policymakers examine their budget management practices upon whether they promote budget responsibility or not. The catalogue also permits to qualify the budget constraint from ""soft"" to ""hard"" whether it is self-imposed or imposed top-down. Based on these arguments, we consider budget discipline versus budget responsibility. Budget discipline is a forced and constraining approach to obtaining a balanced budget at decentralised levels. The corresponding positive approach is budget responsibility. The balanced budget as a result of a prudent and proactive budget policy through which local governments adjust their investment policy to their real fiscal capacity and assess costs and benefits of each capital programmes in advance, in order to avoid excessive debt.",local debt: from budget responsibility to fiscal discipline,2010,NA,B Dafflon,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Over the past decade, a number of state and local governments have amended land use regulations to permit the accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) on single-family lots. Measured by raw numbers of reforms, the campaign to secure legal reforms permitting ADUs appears to be a tremendous success. The question remains, however, whether these reforms overcome the well-documented land-use parochialism that has, for decades, represented a primary obstacle to increasing the supply of affordable housing. In order to understand more about their actual effects, this Article examines ADU reforms in a context which ought to predict a minimal level of local parochialism. In 2002, California enacted state-wide legislation mandating that local governments either amend their zoning laws to permit ADUs in single-family zones or accept the imposition of a state-dictated regulatory regime. We carefully examined the zoning law of all California cities with populations over 50,000 people (150 total cities) to determine how local governments actually implemented ADU reforms “on the ground” after the state legislation was enacted. Our analysis suggests that the seeming success story masks hidden local regulatory barriers. Local governments have responded to local political pressures by delaying the enactment of ADU legislation (and, in a few cases, simply refusing to do so despite the state mandate), imposing burdensome procedural requirements that are contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the state-law requirement that ADUs be permitted “as of right,” requiring multiple off-street parking spaces, and imposing substantive and procedural design requirements. Taken together, these details likely dramatically suppress the value of ADUs as a means of increasing affordable housing.",a room of one's own: accessory dwelling unit reforms and local parochialism,2013,Urb.

participate in the policy-mahing of other countries; otherwise, a
county can impose costs on other countries without
representation from those countries. This review therefore

"This thesis investigates the effects of supranational and national fiscal rules on fiscal
outcomes in EMU. We investigate intended effects of the rules as well as circumventing
behaviour in the form of shifts towards unconstrained forms of fiscal policy. The study
is motivated by the strong increase in the reliance on fiscal rules - both at supranational
and national level - during the 1990s and the existing controversy about the
effectiveness of fiscal rules. Its contributions include new evidence on the effects of the
preventive part and the debt rule of the EU fiscal framework on fiscal outcomes, and the
measurement of the institutional design of national fiscal rules and analysis of their
effects on fiscal outcomes.
According to theory, fiscal rules can restrain deficit and spending biases, but only if the
costs of non-compliance are large enough to counter these biases. These costs can take
different forms. A widely held view is that fiscal rules can only be effective if backed
by independent enforcement and economically significant penalties in case of noncompliance. Our results on the institutional design of national fiscal rules in EMU
however indicate that they are self-enforced, while independent enforcement is also
lacking for the EU fiscal rules. We argue that incentives for compliance can
nevertheless stem from the specific political and institutional structure within which the
rules have been introduced.
Results confirm expected correlations between the institutional design of fiscal rules
and fiscal outcomes. Stricter rules constrain fiscal outcomes in the hypothesised manner
but also lead to circumventing behaviour. A critical issue concerns the direction of
causality between fiscal rules and fiscal outcomes. We interpret fiscal rules in EMU as a
reflection of a policy response to rising debt ratios (the EU fiscal rules) and expenditure
ratios (national expenditure rules). Given that truly external monitoring and
enforcement do not seem feasible in practice, the strength of fiscal rules seems
ultimately to be determined by the political commitment to the underlying objective that
the rule pursues.

"In recent years, there has been heightened concern about poor fiscal outcomes in both developed and
developing countries. Governments have had to reduce aggregate public spending and deficits due to serious
macroeconomic imbalances. At the same time, governments have had to focus attention on the composition of
spending in deciding where to cut expenditures, i.e. allocative efficiency. Moreover, many have recognized the
need to address often serious problems with technical inefficiency in the use of budgeted resources (World Bank
1992). But while policy makers and researchers have recognized these three basic problems, for the most part
they have not addressed them in an integrated manner. In particular, the interrelationships among these problems
have not been systematically examined. Macroeconomists have focussed the control of aggregate spending and
the deficit. Experts in public administration have worked predominantly on improving technical efficiency.
And, fiscal economists have concentrated on issues of allocative efficiency.1",budgetary institutions and the levels of expenditure outcomes in australia and new zealand,1999,Fiscal institutions and fiscal performance,S Pradhan ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The comparative study of debt and fiscal consolidation has acquired a new focus in the wake of the global financial crisis. This paper re-evaluates the literature on fiscal consolidation that flourished during the 1980s and 1990s. The conventional approach to explanation is based on segmenting episodes of fiscal change into discrete observations. We argue that this misses the dynamic features of government strategy, especially in the choices made between expenditure-based and revenue-based fiscal consolidation strategies. We propose a focus on pathways rather than episodes of adjustment, to capture what Pierson terms ‘politics in time’. A case-study approach facilitates analysis of complex causality that includes the structures of interest intermediation, the role of ideas in shaping the set of feasible policy choices, and the situation of national economies in the international political economy. We support our argument with qualitative data based on two case studies, Ireland and Greece, and with additional paired comparisons of Ireland with Britain, and Greece with Spain. Our conclusions suggest that the conventional literature, by excluding key political variables from consideration, may distort our understanding and result in misleading policy prescription.","fiscal politics in time: pathways to fiscal consolidation in ireland, greece, britain, and spain, 1980–2012",2015,European Political Science …,S Dellepiane-Avellaneda  N Hardiman ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Scholars interested in legislative processes pay relatively little attention to the changes made to bills in parliamentary democracies. On the one hand, comparative research has often described parliamentary institutions as ineffectual vis‐à‐vis cabinets throughout the lawmaking process; on the other hand, for a long time the rational choice literature has focused more on the formal rules regulating amendatory activity than on amendatory activity itself. Hence, very few studies have tried to explain how much government bills are altered in parliament and why. This article investigates the changes made to governmental legislation in Italy. Taking the modifications occurring during the legislative process as the dependent variable, a number of explanatory hypotheses derived from both existing scholarship and original arguments are discussed and tested. This also allows the identification of some usually unobserved aspects of the decision‐making process within the cabinet. The findings can also be relevant for comparative research since Italy has been characterised during the period under scrutiny (1987–2006) by two distinct electoral systems, two extremely different party systems (pivotal and alternational), governments with various ideological orientations and range, and both partisan and technical ministers.","horses and hippos: why italian government bills change in the legislative arena, 1987–2006",2013,European Journal of Political …,"A Pedrazzani, F Zucchini ",Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1337

"Theorists have long argued that democratic policymakers respond to political pressures from their constituents. Although empirical work generally supports that broad contention, heterogeneity prevails both in theoretical work and empirically across country-times over exactly what comprises the constituency to which policymakers respond. We propose conceiving the potential bases of democratic representation as a continuum from the interests of the policymaker's geographic constituency, her electoral district, d, to those of her party's supporters, her partisan constituency, p. The effective constituency, c, to which democratic policymakers respond would then be some convex combination of these partisan and geographic extremes, with the partisan weight summarized by the degree to which parties are able to act as strategic units and receive their electoral support as units, i.e., of party unity, u. That is, heuristically, we conceptualize c=u*p+(1-u)*d. Re-examination of the familiar Weingast-Shepsle-Johnsen (WSJ) model of distributive politics and pork-barrel spending (the law of 1/n) motivates the analysis and undergirds empirical evaluation of our conception of the effective constituency. Postwar histories of public spending and distributive politics in developed democracies seem not to support a pure-electoral- district WSJ model, but postwar public spending in the United States, where data best-suited to evaluate the argument exist, does support a WSJ model as modified to reflect our conception of the effective constituency. We conclude with some ideas for extending the basic effective constituency notion beyond partisan and geographic bases of representation and for incorporating more explicitly and directly into empirical specification of public-policy models certain theoretical propositions that purport to explain aspects of the political-economic institutional, structural, and strategic context, such as the degree of party unity, that shape how policymakers allocate their efforts across public-good, redistributive, distributive, and rent-seeking activities. We consider several such arguments relating political-economic institutional, structural, and strategic contexts to the degree of party unity and of geographic versus partisan representation, and thereby to policymakers' weight on each type of policy activity, and show how to embed and test such arguments within estimable empirical models of public spending using the effective constituency concept.",crony capitalism: by-product of big government,2004,Geographic Versus Partisan,"RJ Franzese, I Nooruddin ",Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1339
"The Supreme Court's decision in Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, denying antitrust immunity for local governments exercising home-rule authority, significantly extends the reach of the Sherman Act. Considering especially the vague contours of antitrust laws, the new exposure of local governments to liabilities for policy-judgment ""errors"" is potentially broad. The immediate effect of enforcing antitrust surveillance of local government decisions will be to displace local policy criteria with national antitrust criteria. In the longer term, however, the effect will be to shift power and discretion to the states, as local governments seek to avoid the threat of liability by obtaining specific authority for their actions from state legislatures. The consequential displacement of local prerogative is not required by antitrust policy, and it is at odds with multitiered and diversified federalism.",the sherman act as a home rule charter: community communications co. v. city of boulder,1983,Supreme Court Economic Review,GO Robinson ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The United States health care system is a tragic product of blind distrust of government and unquestioning faith in markets—the belief that the market will always do a more efficient job of allocating resources better than the government. However, health care is a peculiar commodity that differs from other goods and services that are distributed in the market. There is a real question about whether it is appropriate to provide health coverage pursuant to an insurance model, let alone provide it through an insurance model in the market. While the pooling of risks guarantees a greater number of people will suffer the full impact of loss, the insurance model yields corrupted results because it is subjected to the dictates of the market, and profit maximization prevents high-risk individuals from entering the pool of insured individuals.

Fragmented coverage for some individuals, and no coverage for many others, produces negative externalities in the form of higher costs, which is why the insurance model is defective: it depends upon the exploitation of externalities for its success. Attempting to provide coverage through this model results in inadequate health coverage and ineffective cost containment. The appropriate governmental response would be to provide subsidies that induce the production of positive externalities, while prohibiting or penalizing activity that produces negative externalities. Without federal intervention, citizens will not consume health care at socially optimal levels. Unfortunately, efforts to intervene have resulted in insurers and employers engaging in or threatening a flight from health insurance, which may leave even fewer people protected. In effect, American health care policy is being held hostage by infatuation with markets, reducing coverage for increased payments along the way.","markets, myths, and a man on the moon: aiding and abetting america's flight from health insurance",1999,Rutgers L.

"In Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation, Inc., the Supreme Court denied jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiffs, as taxpayers, lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of alleged efforts to secure preferential federal funding for religious charitable organizations. In doing so, the Court split three ways on the proper scope and application of Flast v. Cohen, a Warren Court decision which allows taxpayer suits to challenge governmental spending allegedly in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. While the Court did not overrule Flast, its decision casts substantial doubt over Flast’s future. This article explores the implications of Hein, both as a standing decision and as a harbinger of future Establishment Clause developments. After evaluating the theoretical limitations of existing standing jurisprudence, the article turns to reciprocity theory as a medium for explaining Flast’s deviation from Frothingham v. Mellon’s general rule against taxpayer standing. The article demonstrates that Flast is based upon the constitutionally non-reciprocal character of spending in aid of religion. It further demonstrates that Hein’s departure from Flast redefines the concept of constitutional injury in establishment cases, both by treating faith-based funding as reciprocal and thus indistinguishable from other sorts of spending, and by denying the existence of intangible or psychic injury when religious preference in the implementation of such funding allegedly occurs. As a consequence, Hein signals a major shift in Supreme Court thinking about the substantive scope of the Establishment Clause.",forks taken and roads not taken: standing to challenge faith-based spending,2010,Cardozo L.

"Two strains of literature have come out of the research addressing the size and duration of the United States federal government budget deficit. The first, focusing on budget control, deals with causality issues between expenditures and revenues. The second addresses the sustainability of the budget deficit. Here, one finds the rational expectations view of debt management. The empirical work in these two areas, however, offers many conflicting results. This paper addresses this confusion by searching for changes in the budget regime. For various reasons the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is the principal point of focus of this empirical investigation. Indirectly, this paper offers a useful framework in which to understand the impact of changes in internal fiscal policies and budget rules that may be required of the countries participating in European economic union.","taxing, spending, and the budget process: the role of budget regimes in the intertemporal budget constraint",1997,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,Wm.

"Federal law significantly limits the political activities of charities, but no one really knows why. In the wake of Citizens United, the absence of any strong normative grounding for the limits may leave the rules vulnerable to constitutional challenge. This Article steps into that breach, offering a set of policy reasons to separate politics from charity. I also sketch ways in which my more-precise exposition of the rationale for the limits helps guide interpretation of the complex legal rules implementing them.

Any defense of the political limits begins with significant challenges because of a long tradition of scholarly criticism of them. Critics of the limits suggest that the “market failures” that justify tax subsidies for charity also afflict group efforts to monitor politicians and organize politically, so that the subsidy should extend to cover those activities. These claims, though, overlook a series of additional issues suggested by transaction cost economics and other aspects of economic theory.

Most significantly, even if lobbying and electioneering should be subsidized, it does not follow that these functions should be carried out by charities. I argue that combining politics with charity produces a set of diseconomies of scope, including higher agency costs, diminished “warm glow” from giving, and greater inframarginality of deduction recipients. In addition, I argue that the economically ideal tools for reaching the socially optimal levels of charity and lobbying are incompatible with one another. While there are also off-setting gains from the combination, many of these gains further exacerbate the diseconomies.",charities in politics: a reappraisal,2012,Wm. & Mary L.

"Do political and fiscal decentralization make it easier or harder to
control inflation? If high inflation reflects the time inconsistency
problem, devolving power might restrict the center’s ability to
renege on promises of monetary stability, thus reducing inflation. If
inflation results from failure to coordinate on a stabilization plan,
devolving power to numerous regional governments should make
matters worse. Other factors thought to affect inflation—openness
to imports, political instability, etc.—may also correlate with
decentralization. This paper examines average annual inflation
rates in a panel of 87 countries in the 1970s and 80s. It finds a
sharp divergence between developed countries—where
decentralization correlates with lower inflation—and developing
countries—where it correlates with higher inflation. Empirical
analysis suggests that decentralization helps preserve central bank
independence in OECD countries, while in non-OECD countries it
increases pressures on the government to overspend and get the
central bank to monetize the deficit. In developing countries,
decentralization of tax authority also seems to reduce imports, thus
reducing the political cost to central government of inflationinduced currency depreciation.",decentralization and inflation in developed and developing countries,1998,… of Economics,"D Treisman, DC Welcome ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This paper shows that electoral incentives deter politicians from supporting trade liberalization. We focus on all major trade liberalization bills introduced since the early 1970s in the U.S. Congress, in which House and Senate members serve respectively two- and six-year terms and one third of senators face elections every two years. We show that senators are more likely to support trade liberalization than House representatives. However, this result does not hold for the last generation of senators, who face elections at the same time as House members, suggesting that inter-cameral differences are driven by term length. Considering senators alone, we find that the last generation is less likely to support trade liberalization than the previous two. This result is pervasive and holds both when comparing the behavior of different senators voting on the same bill and that of individual senators voting on different bills. The protectionist effect of election proximity disappears for senators who are retiring or hold safe seats.",policymakers' horizon and trade reforms,2011,NA,"P Conconi, G Facchini, M Zanardi",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Beginning in the late 1950's, the federal

 to develop commercial uses of space. Early

High party discipline and high party strength induce legislators to stay committed to the party's promised policies after their election. This is because party leaders are able to punish deviations and reward behavior that is in the party's interest. Higher political stability induces party leaders to take a longer‐term perspective. We investigate the following interrelated hypotheses: (i) the effects of party discipline and party strength on environmental policy are conditional on the degree of political stability; and (ii) the effect of political stability is conditional on the levels of party discipline and party strength.

"George Stigler, in an influential paper on income redistribution, states an observation attributed to Aaron Director as follows : “Public expenditures are made for the primary benefit of the middle classes, and financed with taxes which are borne in considerable part by the poor and the rich.” (GEORGE STIGLER 1970, p.1) As Stigler notes, this relationship, which will henceforth be referred to as Director’s Law, was found by Director through inductive reasoning, based upon empirically observed public spending decisions. Stigler, on the other hand, sets out to lay a theoretical foundation for Director’s Law, and the core of his argument is that the middle income classes dominate political processes under democratic decision-making. Obviously, this argument of middle class domination is related to a wealth of earlier contributions, notably those concerned with the median voter approach, which point in the same direction. Also, a number of later contributions following Stigler have made more refined arguments regarding the influence of general and special interests on political outcomes, as well as regarding the impact of political institutions.",still a director's law? on the political economy of income redistribution,2007,Institute for Research in Economic and …,"LP Feld, J Schnellenbach ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This report provides an analysis of the economic aspects of the Annan Plan by a

that they provide a sound and sustainable basis for the unification process and that they

communities.
The report generally takes as given the political constraints built into the Annan Plan.
This includes the intention of limiting the size and authority of the federal government,
a commitment to compensate dispossessed property owners, a commitment to provide
loss-of-use compensation, the imposition of limits to migration of G/C citizens to the
T/C constituent state, and sensitivity to the use of the Cyprus Pound in the T/C

"Japan adopted new, largely majoritarian, electoral rules in 1994 that have begun to

efficient way to gain a plurality of voters, leaving the old mobilizational strategy in disarray and
consequently put and end to the LDP’s long-term dominance. We speculate that clientelistic

"This dissertation explores party discipline and its policy consequences in two East Asian democracies: Japan and South Korea. Despite personalistic electoral competition, ideological diversity inside the ruling parties, frequent party splits and mergers and switching, and intraparty factional struggles, the leadership in the two countries has been able to maintain the high levels of party unity inside the legislatures and achieve collective goods of stable rule and legislation. In order to solve this puzzling phenomenon, I develop a theory to argue that, in order to achieve high productivity in the legislature, the leadership in the two countries strategically distributes office perks, or various types of privileges available in the government or the party: cabinet minister posts, heads of state-owned corporations and agencies, and pork subsidies. I further argue that the contrasting patterns of allocation of office perks following from the constitutional difference - parliamentarism versus presidentialism - cause divergent consequences in party unity. In order to support this theoretical claim, I utilize original datasets on legislators' roll call votes on the legislative floors and on fiscal spending in Japan and South Korea. First, data on roll call votes confirm that access to office perks is a significant factor in maintaining party unity: in Japan, when the leadership broke down the existing norm to sustain party unity, a group of backbenchers defected; and in Korea, ruling party members affiliated with the president tend to show higher unity, but such unity tends to decrease over time. Second, analysis at fiscal spending shows that pork is strategically used by the leadership to maintain party unity: in Japan, when the leadership incorporates intra- party factions into the cabinet, upward pressures on pork- related budget items are found; and in Korea, the president greases the wheels by allocating more money to presidential supporters when the ruling party has a majority in the legislature.",committing to the party: the costs of governance in east asian democracies,2009,NA,K Nemoto,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Do established parties change political institutions to disadvantage smaller, non-mainstream parties if the latters’ electoral prospects improve? We study this question with a natural experiment from the German federal state of Hesse. The experiment is the abolishment of an explicit electoral threshold (the so called “five percent hurdle”) for local elections in 2001 by the Hessian state parliament. The abolishment improved the electoral prospects of smaller parties at local elections, but local politicians from large mainstream parties had the ability to adjust municipal political institutions in such a way as to counteract the increased competitiveness of smaller parties. One such institutional adjustment is to reduce the size of the local council and thereby raise implicit electoral thresholds. Using a dataset that covers all 426 Hessian municipalities over the period 1989-2011, we document with a difference-indiscontinuity design that municipalities where the electoral competitiveness of smaller parties improved more because of the abolishment of the explicit threshold, reduced their council size more.

"This paper argues that Argentina´s federal fiscal institutions lead to a serious common
pool problem that in turn causes a deficit bias. Fiscal rules, which in other countries are
used to mitigate deficit biases, have not worked in Argentina. However, the budget
process is de facto very hierarchical. This means that when the Executive has fiscal
resources available to allocate with discretionality – i.e. during good economic times – it
can implement its policy agenda with more ease. Since the Executive is likely to value
fiscal solvency more than other political actors, fiscal policy in Argentina is especially
volatile, with strong improvements during good times and deterioration during
recessions. Thus, fiscal policy is an outcome of the interaction of economic shocks and
underlying institutions.

We posit that ""residual capital expenditure"" best captures a country's level of fiscal particularism, and we investigate this hypothesis with national and subnational data from fifty-two countries over twenty years. After controlling for basic economic factors determining capital expenditure , we find that residual pork spending is greatest when taxation is centralized and spending decisions are decentralized, i.e. the fiscal cost-benefit principle is broken. Under these conditions, legislators can distribute pork with higher electoral efficiency, because voters do not fully internalize the link between more particularistic spending (the benefits) and higher taxes (the costs). Additionally, pork is exacerbated by institutional features that add geographically responsive political actors, such as the presidency or single member districts. To further illustrate how capital expenditure can provide a good measure of pork, we discuss the case of Japan.","fiscal decentralization, and particularistic spending across countries",2002,… Analysis of Political …,"A Diaz-Cayeros  KM McElwain, V Romero… ",Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1371
"This article undertakes a critical examination of the usefulness
of fiscal responsibility laws in situations of institutional weakness. It
analyses the case of Argentina, where prodigal use of fiscal rules (two
different laws in just five years) contrasts with their limited effectiveness
for fiscal policy sustainability and transparency, and it confirms that in
situations of institutional weakness a fiscal responsibility law is unlikely
to constrain government decision-making to the extent necessary to
correct the behaviour of the public finances. The case of Argentina thus
provides a warning for supporters of fiscal rules. When fiscal credibility is
low and institutions weak, not only may such rules be fiscally ineffective,
but non-enforcement may weaken yet further the fragile institutional
context which made them so ineffective to begin with",what are fiscal rules for?: a critical analysis of the argentine experience,2007,Cepal Review,"M Braun, N Gadano ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"The term ""liberty"" makes three appearances in the Constitution. The preamble identifies among the Constitution's
purposes securing ""the blessings of liberty to ourselves and
our posterity."" The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the federal and state governments, respectively, from
depriving ""any person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law."" The preamble has not been a source of
much controversy, possibly because it serves only a precatory
function.' The liberty safeguarded by the due process
clauses, however, has been a source of considerable dispute.2
This is especially true of the Fourteenth Amendment's liberty, which has passed its older sibling by ingesting most of
the Bill of Rights.'
Defining the protection of liberty under these clauses is
no easy matter. Three problems frustrate interpretive efforts.
First, interpretive criteria must be selected. This is a general
problem of constitutional adjudication, but it has particular
importance for provisions as ambiguous and potentially farreaching as the due process clauses. Second, a framework for
analyzing due process issues must be constructed. This effort
is largely informed by principles that underlie, as well as
those derived from, more general interpretive considerations.
Third, the practical scope of the constitutional protection
must be determined for particular cases or categories. Difficulty in applying the clauses to specific situations reflects the
lack of success at the two prior tasks.",the meaning of liberty: notes on problems within the fraternity,1984,Notre Dame JL Ethics & Pub.

"What explains the performance of external auditing agencies in emerging economies? How relevant are they to improving fiscal governance and controlling corruption? What determines the success or failure of their reform? External audit agencies are an integral part of the system of checks and balances. However, little is known about what explains their effectiveness and what determines their performance. Combining quantitative and qualitative research techniques, the dissertation investigates the political economy of government auditing and budget oversight in emerging economies. Building on earlier findings on the role of political institutions in economic performance, it develops a conceptual framework to assess the effectiveness of external audit agencies. Gathering quantitative data for ten Latin American countries, it develops a performance indicator to assess
the links between external auditing and fiscal governance. It then investigates three case studies, Argentina, Brazil and Chile, illustrating the three main models of external auditing. The dissertation finds a correlation between the credibility of audit agencies and the quality of governance. It demonstrates that dysfunctions in systems of fiscal control are systemic,
not agency specific. The choice of institutional arrangements for government auditing bears
limited explanatory power. Accountability gaps in public finances originate in wider dysfunctions
in the systems of fiscal control. The effectiveness of external audit agencies depends on the
quality of their insertion into the system of fiscal control and the political economy of executivelegislative budget relations.
The research reveals a paradox of independence: while external audit agencies must be
sufficiently autonomous to be effective and credible, they need to develop efficacious relations
with the other components of the system of fiscal control with the necessary powers to enforce
accountability on government, in particular parliaments. The research also underscores that
external audit agencies must be reformed inasmuch as they must be strengthened. However, reform strategies based on radical change or institutional transplant of exogenous models are likely to fail. Effective reform must be couched in the country’s broader public governance and trajectory of institutional change. This research expands knowledge on oversight agencies and
opens avenues for further research on the role of parliaments in public budgeting.",auditing for accountability,2007,Political economy of government,C Santiso ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

Section 2 reviews the rationale for fiscal governance, and the main focus draws upon the common-pool problem. The next section reviews methods to find the fiscal governance suitable for countries with differing political environments. Next, observed fiscal governance is reported by means of indices from survey data gathered in May-June 2004.

"The Treaty of Maastricht established debt and deficit limits which states should meet if they are to participate in a future monetary union. This paper considers the relationship between electoral and legislative institutions on the one hand, and the size of a given European country's budget deficit on the other. Plurality electoral systems have a ""winner-take-all"" rule where only the top vote-getter in each district wins a seat in Parliament. One way incumbent legislators can appeal for support is to bring home particularistic benefits, such as public works projects. Since her district pays only a small portion of the central government's tax revenues, however, she will ask for more spending when the central government pays for them when they have to be paid for with local taxes. In states with proportional representation, on the other hand, candidates do not have the same incentive to offer particularistic benefits to their electorates. Parliamentary rules which restrict or eliminate the ability of legislators to amend budgetary bills will consequently have the greatest effect in limiting spending in states with single member districts. One of the most effective restrictions is that legislators can only approve or disapprove the entire budget under a ""closed rule."" Such rules give the government near or complete agenda-setting power. Legislators cannot attach extra spending in their districts. This theoretical point stands in contrast to authors who would predict that a move to single member districts alone in a country like Italy would lead directly to lower budget deficits. I will argue that simple change in the electoral system could lead to higher deficits if legislators are not prevented from providing particularistic benefits to their districts. Similarly restrictive parliamentary rules found in France and the United Kingdom are needed in Italy, for instance, if spending is to be limited at the legislative stage.",the common pool problem in european parliaments: the interrelationship of electoral and legislative institutions,1997,NA,M Hallerberg,Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1387
"An old common law rule, made manifest in the corrupt practices acts of many states, declares void the elections of candidates who promise, if elected, to serve at salaries less than those fixed by law. Many courts regard salary-reduction promises as analogous to bribes, which might lead to the election of wealthy or unfit officeholders, and which would turn the citizenry's attention away from ""proper"" public-policy issues. In Brown v. Hartlage the Supreme Court overturned on first amendment grounds the application of a Kentucky law, which had voided the election of an officeholder who had made such a promise. This essay reviews the case law and Brown v. Hartlage. It then analyzes the salary-reduction strategy and finds little substantial or consistent support for the conclusion that the use of this strategy produces the undesirable effects predicted and therefore should be against public policy. Instead, judicial and legislative prohibitions on the use of the salary-reduction strategy appear to provide protection for favored incumbents against their election challengers",the compensation of public officials as a campaign issue: an economic analysis of brown v. hartlage,1983,Supreme Court Economic Review,"PH Aranson, KA Shepsle ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Studies of EU trade policymaking often suggest that delegation of trade authority from the national to the European level strengthened the autonomy of public actors in formulating trade policies. Little empirical research, however, has been undertaken to corroborate this contention. To improve on this situation, I carry out two case studies of the EU’s participation in the multilateral trade negotiations known as the Kennedy Round (1964-67) and the Doha Development Agenda (2001 onwards). The analysis reveals that in both cases the EU’s negotiating position was largely in line with the demands voiced by economic interests. Although this finding is no proof of economic interests actually determining EU trade policies, it casts some doubt on the autonomy thesis.

"Theoretical and empirical analysis suggests that federations are prone to fiscal indiscipline,
because of a classic “common-pool” problem of distributive politics—when decisionmaking power over government spending is distributed across multiple agents but financed
out of generalized taxation. An institutional solution typically adopted by many countries
is the delegation of sub-national debt oversight to the national political executive, which is
assumed to have stronger incentives for fiscal discipline. Can such delegation successfully
address political distortions to fiscal discipline? This paper provides evidence on this
question from India, arguing that such delegation has limited success because the political
incentives of the national government are such that it is unwilling or unable to enforce hard
budget constraints on sub-nationals. In light of this evidence, the paper explores the role of
an alternate form of delegation, to an independent fiscal agency, of monitoring and
oversight of consolidated government debt, as a solution to the common- pool problem,
again providing evidence from India to support its arguments. ",can delegation promote fiscal discipline in a federation? evidence from fiscal performance in the indian states,2006,… Paper.

"Because the American states operate under balanced budget requirements, increases in spending in one area typically entail equal and opposite budget cuts in other programs. The literature analysing the correlates of government spending by policy area has mostly ignored these trade-offs inherent to policymaking, failing to address one of the most politically interesting and important dimensions of fiscal policy. Borrowing from the statistical literature on compositional data, we present more appropriate and efficient methods that explicitly incorporate the budget constraint into models of spending by budget category. We apply these methods to eight categories of spending from the American states over the years 1984–2009 to reveal winners and losers in the scramble for government spending. Our findings show that partisan governments finance their distinct priorities by raiding spending items that the opposition prefers, while different political institutions, economic conditions and state demographics impose different trade-offs across the budget.",something's got to give: the political economy of state budget trade-off,2007,Annual Meeting of the Midwest Political Science …,"C Adolph, C Breunig, C Koski ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Politicians tend to push the amount of public debt beyond socially desirable levels in order to increase their reelection chances. We develop a model that provides a new explanation for this behavior: office holders undertake debt‐financed public projects, but postpone the timing of part of the output to the next term. This makes it difficult to replace them. As a consequence, the office holders' reelection chances rise - as does public debt. As a potential remedy for this inefficiency, we allow candidates for public office to offer government debt‐threshold contracts. Such a contract contains an upper limit for government debt and the sanction that an office holder violating this limit cannot stand for reelection. We show that such competitively offered contracts contain low debt levels that limit debt financing and improve the citizens' welfare.

"The early American political theorists could not have anticipated the country's current fiscal problems, but also they were hardly ignorant of the possibility. Sovereigns have commonly defaulted throughout history. The key is to constrain government spending and deficits. One constraint is a broad tax base, a constraint that was largely applicable in the United States until the Sixteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution, permitting collection of income taxes without regard to the enumeration of the population. The decreasing share of tax liability borne by low-income households and the increasing share of tax liability borne by high-income households are clearly associated with greater government debt and entitlement spending.

"As the ""Short Twentieth Century"" came to an end, more and more democracies seriously considered the possibility –often for the first time in their history- of changing their national electoral system. Since then, the total number of electoral reforms enacted in countries that select their rulers through free and fair elections has sharply increased: in the last two decades over 33% of the world's democratic states modified the formula employed for choosing the members of their national legislatures, and a similar percentage adjusted other elements of the rules of the game such as the district magnitude, the legal threshold, the assembly size or the ballot structure. Unfortunately, the academic examination of the causes and consequences of these episodes of institutional change has lagged well behind these empirical developments with single case studies and small n studies still the norm. In light of this gap, research on the determinants and the outcomes of electoral reform processes is increasingly needed. The aim of this study is to transcend the analysis of a small number of cases, and instead to comparatively examine the universe of electoral system changes that have occurred in 60 contemporary democracies between 1945 and 2010. The thesis has three main findings. First, the levels of party system fragmentation and citizens' satisfaction with democracy have strong potential to explain electoral system changes in contemporary democracies. Contrary to what is usually implied by the literature on electoral reform, parties are seen to have strong tendencies to pass restrictive rather than permissive electoral system changes in circumstances where the electoral system might be considered to be already overly-permissive resulting in excessive numbers of parties. Moreover, electoral reforms in the intraparty dimension usually take place when large numbers of voters are currently dissatisfied with the way democracy works in their country. The second main finding is that electoral reforms can reshape the morphology of established party systems through two distinct mechanisms of electoral engineering. The first mechanism takes place at the interparty level, with permissive reforms reducing the difference between the percentage of votes received and the percentage of seats obtained by a party, and restrictive reforms enlarging this gap. The second mechanism operates at the intraparty level, where candidate-centred reforms decrease the level of party system nationalization while partycentred reforms leave party system nationalization unchanged. Finally, the third main finding of the thesis is that parties' positions regarding the possible modification of the rules of the game have an electoral effect. Parties that advocate a permissive reform in countries with low party system fragmentation are more likely to electorally benefit. By contrast, support for such reforms when the number of parties is large is more likely to result in electoral loses.",changing the rules of the game: on the determinants and consequences of electoral reforms in contemporary democracies,2013,NA,P Riera,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Do representatives elected from majority-black districts allocate more federal projects to black constituents than representatives from black influence districts? In this paper, I argue that studying distributive policy decisions - where legislative coalitions may be universal - may be preferable when assessing the efficacy of black-majority versus black influence districts. Further, when examining the allocation of distributive policy projects to African-Americans, drawing black decisive districts is critical to enhancing African-American influence. Black decisive districts are a new category of districts I introduce to the debate over voting rights and racial redistricting: they are districts that are highly likely to elect an African-American representative, yet they are districts that are still electorally competitive. I argue that these black decisive districts improve African-American substantive representation in Congress and these districts fit within the law as established in Georgia v.

"This paper develops an open-economy growth model to analyze the growth and welfare effects of the European Union’s R&D policy. In the case of independent countries, each national government chooses the level of government-funded research non-cooperatively and fails to internalize the spillover effects across countries. Consequently, government-funded research is underprovided. In an economic union, the central government budget causes the common-pool problem and leads to an overprovision of government-funded research. Within this framework, we find that although an economic union dominates independent countries in economic growth, the welfare domination is ambiguous. In particular, there is a critical degree of cross-country spillover above (below) which an economic union dominates (is dominated by) independent countries in social welfare.",a politico-economic analysis of the european union's r&d policy,2009,Journal of Macroeconomics,AC Chu ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"This article investigates the causal effect of the majority party's electoral outcomes on the allocation of government spending in Japan, using prefectural data from 1981 to 1999. We first articulate the difficulty in consistently estimating the majority party's influence on the allocation of government spending due to the endogeneity of electoral outcomes. The endogeneity of electoral outcomes is more serious when the majority party makes decisions on the allocation of government spending in order to win the elections. The amount of rainfall on election days offers an exogenous variation of the electoral outcomes of the majority party across regions. Therefore, we use the amount of rainfall on election days to estimate the causal effect of the electoral outcomes on the allocation of government spending. The weather on election days affects the behavior of voters in many regions, in turn affecting the majority party's electoral outcomes.

"The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the numerical fiscal rules in force in the 25 countries of the European Union, examines the reasons for the growing appetite for such rules, and assesses whether they have an influence on budgetary developments. The analysis is based on a new dataset constructed from questionnaires submitted to experts in finance ministries of EU countries which report a large amount of information on the numerical fiscal rules in force in the EU countries over the 1990-2005 period. The paper shows that the number of fiscal rules in force in the EU countries has increased in the past decades. The introduction of the Maastricht Treaty and of the SGP seem to have been catalysts for the introduction of fiscal rules. The analysis, based on the estimation of augmented fiscal reaction functions, confirms the existence of a relation between numerical fiscal rules and budgetary developments. The results show that some dimensions matter particularly for the capacity of fiscal rules to influence fiscal policy. Notably, the share of government finances covered by rules and the presence of strong enforcement mechanisms seem to be particularly relevant. The analysis also shows that there is a link between the design of numerical fiscal rules and the stabilisation function of fiscal policy. These findings confirm that while numerical fiscal rules can be useful devices to ensure better policies, careful attention should be devoted to the way they are designed.",beyond the sgp,2007,… General for Economic … 2007 - researchgate.net,J Ayuso-i-Casals  DG Hernandez… ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In the literature on fiscal federalism, vertical fiscal imbalance has been widely studied, while the theme of horizontal fiscal imbalance and inequality among local governments, due to differences in their fiscal capacities, has been less explored. This article contributes to fill the gap. A new method to compute fiscal capacities based on regression analysis is proposed, which can overcome some of the drawbacks of traditional methods such as the representative tax system. This new approach is then employed to evaluate the fiscal capacities of Italian municipalities over the period 2002–2010. Finally two global measures of the horizontal fiscal imbalance are used to evaluate the equity implication of a major policy change occurred in 2008 in Italian municipal finance",measuring horizontal fiscal imbalance: the case of italian municipalities,2016,Local Government Studies,"G Di Liddo, E Longobardi, F Porcelli ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Driven by the desire to fulfill the Maastricht fiscal criteria and pressed by mounting debt burdens that have accumulated over the past 30 years, a majority of EU-15 countries attempted to reduce their budget deficits during the 1990s. Yet, these nations have exhibited remarkable differences in their ability to pursue such retrenchment policies. This paper endeavours to illuminate the political and institutional factors that can help explain those differing degrees of fiscal retrenchment in European Union countries for the time period 1990-2001. Several variants of the partisan approach and the veto players framework are elucidated and applied to the question of budgetary consolidation. These elaborations yield four working hypotheses which are empirically tested using a time-series cross-section data set of 14 EU countries. The results lend support to the notion that a low number of insitutional veto players increases likelihood and extent of a budgetary retrenchment. Given these findings it is possible to draw some conclusions concerning the effectiveness and deficiencies of the Stability and Growth Pact.",partisan preferences and political institutions: explaining fiscal retrenchment in the european union,2004,NA,O Pamp,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In this paper we study a simple model of bailing out and we review theoretical literature
on the “soft budget constraint” in order to interpret the evolution of regional spending, funding and
deficits during the ‘90s in the Italian National Health System. We focus on the health care sector
mainly because bailing out of regional deficits has been a structural characteristic of
intergovernmental relationships. We propose a first empirical test of the main theoretical
implications, building a data set on regional health expenditure, financing, and deficits during the
‘90s. Our main finding suggests that expenditure growth is more related to control of the central
government than to a virtuous behaviour of Italian regions. Moreover, structural reforms (e.g. the
change in the electoral rules for national elections) had probably the effect of increasing the
commitment technology of the central government. Regional spending and financing seems to be
related to some of the “soft budget constraint” proxies, suggesting that a removal of these features
may indeed help to strengthen regional budgets. Finally, we argue that the new Constitution can
spread the “soft budget constraint” disease to other parts of the public sector and this may threaten
financial stability.",fiscal federalism and soft budget constraints in the italian national health service,2002,Il futuro dei sistemi di welfare nazionali tra …,"M Bordignon, G Turati ",Google Scholar,Second,"The full paper either did not employ quantitative methods, or, if it did, did not include legislature size nor public expenditure as independent and dependent variables.",1413
"A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments' discretionary spending cast more ballots for the incumbent party than those who do not benefit. But contrary to most theories of political accountability, some suggest that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing ""programmatic"" spending legislation, over which incumbents have no discretion, and even when passed with support from all major parties. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that would cost them votes. We study the electoral effects of two large prominent programmatic policies that fit the ideal type especially well, with unusually large scale experiments that bring more evidence to bear on this question than has previously been possible. For the first policy, we design and implement ourselves one of the largest randomized social experiments ever. For the second policy, we reanalyze studies that used a large scale randomized experiment and a natural experiment to study the same question but came to opposite conclusions. Using corrected data and improved statistical methods, we show that the evidence from all analyses of both policies is consistent: programmatic policies have no effect on voter support for incumbents. We conclude by discussing how the many other studies in the literature may be interpreted in light of our results.",do nonpartisan programmatic policies have partisan electoral effects? evidence from two large scale experiments,2018,American Journal of Political Science,"K Imai, G King, CV Rivera ",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"In this paper we study the relationship between legislature size with respect to general government and welfare spending. According to the theory, legislature size has an indefinite effect on government spending because logrolling and transaction costs have canceling effects. Bicameralism is expected to have a negative effect because of the increased transaction cost of finding a viable majority in two houses with different constituencies. We use a cross-section of 75 countries over the period 1990-1998 controlling for some institutional features that differ among countries. We find that both legislature size and bicameralism do not have a significant effect on the two types of spending.","legislature size, bicameralism and government spending: evidence from democratic countries",2004,Working Paper,R Ricciuti ,Google Scholar,Final,Paper was included,1415
"Studies of EU trade policymaking often suggest that delegation of trade authority

formulating trade policies. Little empirical research, however, has been undertaken to
corroborate this contention. To improve on this situation, I carry out two case studies
of the EU’s participation in the multilateral trade negotiations known as the Kennedy
Round (1964-67) and the Doha Development Agenda (2001 onwards). The analysis
reveals that in both cases the EU’s negotiating position was largely in line with the
demands voiced by economic interests. Although this finding is no proof of economic
interests actually determining EU trade policies, it casts some doubt on the autonomy

"The paper offers a rational explanation for the notorious inefficient farm support policies within the EU
with an optimization model of legislative behavior and legislative institutions. It is argued that
inefficient agricultural policies can be rationally explained if it is assumed that legislative decision
making is determined by informal norms derived in the shadow of formal institutional rules. First,
maximization of political support implies that different institutional actors, i.e. national members of the
Council, Commissioners and relevant actors of the European Parliament, do prefer different levels of
subsidization for the different national farm sectors. Second, according to the applied specific decision
norm legislators’ preferred policy positions are aggregated to a specific Common Agricultural Policy. In
the formal model informal norms correspond to a specific organization of political exchange, where on
a macro level legislators change political rights to control policies in specific policy domains, and on a
micro level within a policy domain network political control rights are changed over specific policy
dimensions. Beside the importance of the “principle of ministry government”, that is political control
rights over agricultural policies are generally obtained by actors that are politically strongly related to
the farm sector, the model emphasizes the impact (1) of external effects of political exchange and (2)
of the principle of financial solidarity on the efficiency of CAP. Since the foundation of the EU norms
have been changed from less efficient norms, i.e. the Luxembourg Compromise corresponding to
Weingast’s norm of a universal coalition, to more efficient norms reflecting qualified majority voting
within the Council. Observed changes of norms are interpreted as legislators choosing the rules of the
game maximizing their expected benefits, where the enlargement of the EU is identified as a main
factor forcing legislators uniquely to choose new norms.

"This dissertation is a collection of papers that features applications of public
choice theory to the relationship between political constraints, incentives, and individual
economic behavior. The first chapter introduces the two meanings of political
constraints—(i) constraints self-imposed on the political process and (ii) constraints
created by the political process; reviews the public choice literature on political
constraints and incentives; and outlines the research agenda for the dissertation. Chapter
2 examines the possible inefficiencies that may be produced by politicians pursuing their
own self interests by comparing two forms of city government. More specifically,
comparisons are made between professionally trained city managers and popularly
elected mayors, and results show that city managers have a relative efficiency advantage
over elected mayors. Chapter 3 analyzes how minimum drinking age laws influence
drinking behavior by examining the incentive for underage U.S. citizens to cross
international border crossings to avoid the nationally uniform 21-year-old drinking age.
Results show that the occurrence of alcohol-related motor-vehicle fatalities, the most
serious outcome of mixing drinking and driving, increases as proximity to the nearest
border crossing decreases. Chapter 4 enhances the reported link between
entrepreneurship and economic growth, tests the causal relationship between venture
funding and entrepreneurial activity, and ultimately reveals which policies create a good
environment for entrepreneurship. Results show that entrepreneurial activity draws
venture funding to an area, and not vice versa. Therefore, the results suggest that enacting
policies consistent with economic freedom, such as low taxes, low regulations, and
secure property rights that provide a good environment for attracting or developing
individual entrepreneurs, are the appropriate economic development policies. Chapter 5

"There is an intensive dispute in political economics about the impact of institutions on income redistribution. While the main focus is on comparison between different forms of representative democracy, the influence of direct democracy on redistribution has attracted much less attention. In this paper, employing both a composite index and measures of single institutions, we find that direct democracy is particularly associated with lower welfare spending. Moreover, we estimate a model which explains the determinants of achieved redistribution measured by Gini coefficients using panel data provided by the Swiss Federal Tax Office from 1981 to 1997. While our results indicate that less public funds are used to redistribute income and actual redistribution is lower, inequality is not reduced to a lesser extent in direct than in representative democracies for a given initial income distribution.",the effect of direct democratic institutions on income redistribution: evidence from switzerland,2007,NA,"LP Feld, JAV Fischer, G Kirchgässner",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

"Do local policymakers strategically use delay in permitting development to forestall the growth machine? The mantras of smart growth and sustainable development assume local governments can balance the competing values of economic development, ecology, and equity interests in a community. We employ a political market framework to explain differences in local government land use decisions. This framework conceptualizes policy choices as resulting from the interplay between the aggregate policy demand by residents, developers, and environmental interests and the aggregate supply by government authorities. Delays can be imposed strategically through processes of development approval by city governments where industry strength and form of government vary within county‐level service‐delivery fragmentation.

"A diverse and growing literature ties legislative professionalization and power to career paths. In particular, higher rates of reelection and longer legislative careers should produce more professional, competent, and high-quality legislatures.

Using data from the most recent constitutional convention in Brazil, we show that legislators with greater prospects for long careers were actually less likely to support strengthening the legislative branch.

"A large literature on the ‘flypaper effect’ examines how federal grants to states at time period t affect state spending (or taxes) at time period t. We explore the fundamentally different question of how federal grants at time period t affect state tax policy in the future. Federal grants often result in states creating new programs and hiring new employees, and when the federal funding is discontinued, these new state programs must either be discontinued or financed through increases in state own source taxes. Government programs tend to be difficult to cut, as goes Milton Friedman’s famous quote about nothing being as permanent as a temporary government program, suggesting that it is likely that temporary federal grants create permanent (future) ratchets in state taxes. Far from being purely an academic question, this argument is why South Carolina’s Governor Mark Sanford attempted to turn down federal stimulus monies for his state. We examine both the impact of federal grants on future state budgets and how federal and state grants affect future local government budgets. Our findings confirm that grants indeed result in future state and local tax increases of roughly 40 cents for every dollar in grant money received in prior years.",do intergovernmental grants create ratchets in state and local taxes? testing the friedman-sanford hypothesis,2010,NA,"RS Sobel, GR Crowley",Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.

produce very different results. In particular, a federal social insurance scheme, chosen by voting, provides overinsurance, whereas an

"Political economy suggests that the common pool problem is pervasive in public budget making. Special interest groups exploit a common pool of public revenue, which leads to expansion of public outlays. A fragmented party structure facilitates the exploitation of a common resource pool, while broad and centralized political parties can eliminate the problem. A number of empirical papers appear to support this hypothesis. We add to the literature by examining the micro-mechanisms of budget making, notably the notion that representatives from small political parties want larger spending increases than do representatives of encompassing parties. Moreover, prior studies assume that the strength of parties is an exogenous factor that affects public spending levels. Yet, citizens may respond to party fragmentation and common pool expansion by voting for rightist parties. We find that a lower share of socialist representatives leads to more fragmentation, which tends to increase local spending and taxes.",does party fragmentation matter?

"The rejection of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe by the French and Dutch electorates in the 2005 referendums stands in sharp contrast to its overwhelming endorsement by politicians from both the government and opposition benches in the two countries. French and Dutch politicians were not alone in endorsing the Constitution. The Constitution received comfortable majorities in all countries which sought to ratify it through a parliamentary vote rather than a referendum. This “most intractable conflict” between voters and their elected representatives is the focus of the present work. Specifically, our purpose is to study why politicians may support more integration than voters.   On this account we differ from other, perhaps better-trodden, modes of inquiry which focus on the questions of whether in the light of some normative criteria the Constitution was “good” or “bad” and why voters rejected it. In its quest the paper uses the insights of political economy, which views elected public office holders as rational actors who seek to maximize their utility from office given the institutional constraints of their environment. The paper is structured as follows. Section 1 discusses the progress made so far towards ratification of the proposed EU Constitution. Section 2 reviews the merits and shortcomings of referendums as a method of ratifying constitutional revisions. Section 3 analyses reasons why the referendum outcome may differ from the parliamentary ratification outcome.

Cohesion is a function of 1) who selects party leaders, and 2) who nominates election candidates. Where party leaders are picked by MPs, who in turn are chosen by the constituency party organization, legislators have stronger incentives to distribute private goods and can resist attempts by party leaders to restrain spending. However, where party leaders are responsible to a broader party selectorate AND have exclusive power to nominate election candidates, parties are much better at curbing common pool resource problems that generate higher government deficits. Based on an original dataset of party cohesion, covering 120 political parties in 17 OECD countries (1960-1990), I find that the balance of power between party leaders and rank-and-file MPs accounts for a greater proportion of government deficits than do the electoral system or cabinet composition.",herding cats in parliament: party cohesion and government spending in advanced industrial democracies,2006,Annual Meeting of the American Political Science …,KM McElwain ,Google Scholar,First,"Abstract did not indicate that the study tested neither size of legislature nor public expenditure as main or minor variables.
